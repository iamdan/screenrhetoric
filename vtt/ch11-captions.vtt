[soft distant bird chirps]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Male narrator) The video on screen
captures YouTube’s content

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
blocking system. I decided to include this
because it happens all the time.

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:14.105
[bird chirps]

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.790
We aim for fair use, and it's 
frustrating when a video—

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.440
one crafted to evoke a feeling 
or convey a message,

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:24.193
one that makes transformative 
use of materials,

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.631
one that represents a good deal 
of creative investment

00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:30.691
—is blocked algorithmically by YouTube.

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:36.373
The algorithm, it turns out, is very good
at identifying the materials in a video.

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:37.516
[bubbles in water]

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.949
[flute music, sounds of typing]

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:56.688 line:1
(Male student) So that segment with the
damselflies

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.831
and the small blue winged olives, I
thought that was

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.460 line:1
[nature sounds, soft music]

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:06.263 line:1
a really, really good segment to put in 
because, you know, these bugs,

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.149 line:1
on the river, these insects, have 
such a finite life period.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.765 line:1
[flute, nature sounds]

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:15.369 line:1
They’re born in the water and they are
literally swept up by the current.

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:19.053
And they spend their days 
free-falling down the river,

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.232
with no control over their path.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:25.421
And in a lot of ways, that’s 
kind of how we feel as humans.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:28.995
But something that

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.001
[flute, birds chirps]

00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:36.097
that fishing provides us, 
that feeling of stableness

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.979
and control, and being at peace.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:43.996
And so these bugs, they get 
above water for a few days

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:47.166
and they lay their eggs, and they 
come back down and they die.

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.546
And it’s a short existence,

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:55.846
but they play this incredibly important 
role in the ecosystem of the river.

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:59.874
And in that way, so do we as people.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:01.308
[flute fades out]

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:09.143
(Narrator) The narration about the 
damselfly comes from Thompson Long.

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:14.073
I picked that clip because the voice 
really pulled me in and it speaks to what

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:19.602
Nigel Harwood identifies as
decision-making criteria behind citation,

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.739
like crediting, supporting, and engaging.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.479 line:1
And Thompson's video extends these
with a personal connection to fishing.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.659 line:1
[bird chirps]

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.540 line:1
Thompson is teaching as he 
discusses his video sources.

00:02:32.547 --> 00:02:35.277 line:1
The discussion of the 
sources creates a layer

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:37.826 line:1
that operates on a 
meta level to those found

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:40.726 line:1
in the composing space 
of the video editor,

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:44.802 line:1
a layer to which has been 
applied an educational transformation.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.579 line:1
The YouTube algorithm, to my knowledge,
doesn't check for that.

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:49.753
[bird chirps]

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.221 line:1
And why should it? That's something
produced through exchange.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:57.277 line:1
Reading is not a disenchanted parsing 
of a fixed, original text.

00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:02.777 line:1
It's a prosumer process, where we copy
to view and perform to read.

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:05.857 line:1
And that's not to say 
the algorithm is unhelpful.

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:10.097 line:1
In fact, it's the kind of thing that might
transform the way we work with sources.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.494 line:1
We can filter, sort, list, even cite 
with the help of a machine

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:19.364 line:1
as we turn toward the thoughts and
feelings associated with the materials.

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:24.075
Why not a meta-container 
for personal meaning?

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.058
(Female student) So I actually first heard
this poem through a contest

00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:34.172
that my tenth grade class held.
And the poem that won was

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:38.823
"I Wondered as Lonely as a Cloud."
And I remember each day we heard the poem,

00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:42.540
it was recited by my good friend, Heather.
This is Heather right here.

00:03:42.727 --> 00:03:46.803
And just the way she spoke,
the way she portrayed this poem,

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:52.185
if I were to imagine a daffodil as a
person it would definitely be Heather.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.767
(Second female student) This video was
filmed in Australia,

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.379
which is where I was born,
so right off the bat I felt

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.539
an emotional connection to this piece.

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:06.697
Throughout a lot of the video you can see
the drone that’s carrying the camera,

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:09.923
so I had to find a segment 
that didn’t show the drone

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:14.173
so that it would not interfere with 
the theme of birds and being free.

00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:17.206
Something about the drone 
being visible in the shot

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:19.496
took away from the symbolic 
meaning of the poem.

00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:20.951
[birds and soft music]

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.938
I also just couldn’t believe how
high up the drone could fly

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.437
and the beautiful sights it captured.

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:31.341
I felt like this video perfectly captured
the sentiment I was going for,

00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:35.446
of feeling liberated, because of the
gradual rise of the camera

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:38.012
and how it looked down on the earth below.

00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:43.674
In this instance, I don’t feel like my use
of the artist’s work devalued theirs.

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.661
Hopefully this is another 
case of enhancing the value

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:52.360
of another artist’s work, and using
the concept of intertextuality

00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.261
to create something new and beautiful.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:02.644
(Narrator) The clips we just watched 
all required decisions about materials.

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.346
I like that Kaitlyn "gave nods"
to her favorite movies.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.653
And I chose that clip, because it uses
text callouts to discuss its materials.

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:16.242
The lack of sound in the clip allowed me
to engage with Thompson's video

00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:18.942
and speaks to the challenges
of managing attention.

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:19.992
[bird chirp]

00:05:20.092 --> 00:05:23.901
Too much typing and noise 
at the same time, and it's hard to focus.

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:28.777
I like that Smriti chose her subject based
on a happy memory of her good friend.

00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:33.278
And I like the way Emily points toward
her personal connection with a video

00:05:33.278 --> 00:05:36.547
from Australia and guides us through the
difficulties (and rewards)

00:05:36.547 --> 00:05:38.457
that came from working with the clip.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:41.999
And I like how Emily's discussion
calls for new approaches

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.113
when it comes to citation
of time-based materials.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.544
Her discussion of the 
changing camera height

00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:51.414
and an emerging sense 
of liberty makes me wonder

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:54.774
how to link such insights 
to a citational reference.

00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:57.748
And I wonder about the 
affordances of multimedia,

00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:00.748
as Emily unpacks the clip, 
bringing words back

00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:04.748
to the citational video even 
as they reveal the abstract

00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:06.555
and ambiguous richness

00:06:07.654 --> 00:06:08.654
and limitations

00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:11.238
of the moving visuals beneath.

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:19.309
(Third female student)
Um, but I came across this and I said, oh,

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:21.719
you know, this is promising,
make your own lanyard.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.239
And it wasn’t exactly what 
I wanted but it did have

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:26.429
a song that I decided I fell in love with.

00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:31.615
(Radio voice) Supergoodmusic.com,
the song is called "Thieves and Kings."

00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:36.243
[song, "Thieves and Kings," plays]

00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:40.445
So obviously this wasn’t a 
very good video to be using,

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:45.505
but I loved the song. So I 
decided to rip this video

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.915
and I used the song for my e-poem.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.060
(Fourth female student) So whenever
I hear this piece of music

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.910
I imagine all the millions of people
in the world

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.911
all kind of focused in on their 
own complicated lives

00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:59.831
but still somehow connected.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.385
I found this to be a 
really powerful feeling,

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:06.535
but I wasn’t sure I would be able to find
a poem that communicated the same ideas.

00:07:07.213 --> 00:07:10.073
So as silly as it sounds, I ended up
googling:

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:17.175
poetry about the vivid complexity of life,
and found exactly what I was looking for.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.037
(Narrator) I'd like to add a category
to our citational metadata:

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:32.729
suggested musical accompaniment.

00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:37.797
Those clips are just two of many
discussing musical choices.

00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:42.155 line:1
And each reveals how an association
adds nuance to a source.

00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:45.688 line:1
And we can make those associations
on multiple levels:

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.948 line:1
from the information-based, 
machine-generated

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.340 line:1
to the conceptual, human-created;

00:07:51.898 --> 00:07:55.498 line:1
from file names, timestamps, 
and edition numbers

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.140 line:1
to whatever we might think 
to link up and assign:

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.021 line:1
music, meanings, meanderings.

00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:06.381
(Fifth female student) To open the e-poem,
I searched high and low

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:08.280

for the obvious footage: some clouds.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.200
This is when I had a little breakthrough
in regards to the meaning of the poem.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.152
It’s a very outside/in type of work,
using the analogy of a fishing trip

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.511
on the scale of the whole world.
Sometimes you’re a fisherman;

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:21.857
you’re in control and you see everything
clearly.

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:23.447
Other times, you’re the fish.

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:26.867
I tried to incorporate this dual-nature
into my e-poem, and I began

00:08:26.927 --> 00:08:29.697
by using a clip that makes the viewer
seem powerful,

00:08:29.817 --> 00:08:32.067
as if the whole world is in 
his or her hands.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.150
This series of first clips open the video
in a strong way,

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:38.201
immediately alerting the viewer
that there is something really

00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:40.577
weighty and significant
discussed in this poem.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.424
(Sixth female student) 
So the next stanza here

00:08:43.424 --> 00:08:47.470
begins with a change in speakers,
so now the mirror is a lake,

00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:51.360
and I picked a droplet of water
that I slowed down

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.330
to be the background
for these words.

00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:58.145
And, as the words 
"a woman bends over me" fade in,

00:08:58.627 --> 00:09:03.019
so does a clip of a woman who barely,
slowly begins to open her eyes.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.640 line:1
And I scaled the clip of the woman
and placed her so that the water droplet

00:09:09.142 --> 00:09:13.112 line:1
is right on her eye, and as it drops,
her eye opens.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:15.344 line:1
So, um, let’s see.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.276 line:1
[mouseclick sounds, soft music]

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:22.886 line:1
I can show right here as it hits, 
her eyes open up with the ripple.

00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:29.019
(Seventh female student) I added
in this clip of the bird chirping.

00:09:29.223 --> 00:09:30.223
[music, bird chirps]

00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:32.913
And then at the end I added in
the other

00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:38.837
clip of a bird chirping,
after the music had faded out.

00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:44.232
[distorted singing; bird chirps]

00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:49.149
So it’s a completely different song;
it’s not created by a human.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:52.382
It’s the song that he is referring to, 
which is the bird.

00:09:55.436 --> 00:10:00.026
[soft birds chirping; typing sounds]

00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:03.801
(Narrator) These videos reveal the rich
metadata

00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:06.621
that comes from capturing 
decision-making about sources.

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:10.396
Amy shows how spending time 
with materials yields insights.

00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:13.314
Nicole links clips to 
composing decisions.

00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:17.256
Hannah points toward the relationship 
between humans and nonhumans.

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:19.376
And all of the videos demonstrate

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.440
the transformational possibilities 
of working with mixings of materials.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:28.077 line:1
So what does this mean as we 
move citation into the digital age?

00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:32.443 line:1
Citations have the potential for 
transforming or reinscribing values.

00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:36.082
Harwood found motivations 
for citations

00:10:36.082 --> 00:10:38.582
were more confrontational
in the humanities.

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:44.253
Fulwiler and Middleton note the hold 
that old logics have upon new media,

00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:48.543
recasting potential disruptions 
within linear paradigms.

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:54.251 line:1
Intellectual cut-throating and values 
linked to fixed, linear logics:

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:56.136 line:1
Pass.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.770 line:1
Perhaps if working with rich 
mixings of materials holds promise,

00:11:00.862 --> 00:11:05.302 line:1
reworking those workings with meta-level, 
process-oriented citations

00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:09.112 line:1
and responses can move us 
toward further transformations.

00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:16.057
(Second female student) I found this video
on Vimeo and it’s from Matt Wood.

00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:20.195
And I found the visual aspect 
of this video to be extremely compelling

00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:23.161
because you get to see a 
bird flying in slow motion,

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.691
which is not something you see everyday.

00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:29.051
It’s also interesting that the bird 
flies so close to the ground

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.860
and seems to stay 
in place for a long time.

00:11:32.997 --> 00:11:35.717
This video made me 
think of Dickinson’s first stanza,

00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:39.654
that describes a feeling of 
being trapped and almost passive.

00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:43.527
I did feel a sense of guilt in borrowing

00:11:43.527 --> 00:11:45.967
this cinematographer’s work 
without permission.

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:48.644
The work is absolutely stunning,

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.197
and I felt like not enough 
credit was given to him.

00:11:52.593 --> 00:11:55.933
However, I do not feel like 
my incorporation of his work devalues it,

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.949
which is a principle of fair use.

00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:02.131
I also feel like incorporating 
his work enhanced

00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.161
the meaning of the Dickinson poem,

00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:06.723
which vibes with 
the concept of "intertextuality,"

00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:10.525
that all texts have a relationship 
to each other in some way.

00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:16.422
(Narrator) I put more of Emily's video 
into the presentation

00:12:16.476 --> 00:12:18.996
because she is thinking 
deeply about use decisions.

00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:23.594
So much of her commentary offers 
the rich, human-oriented metadata

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.328
that might build upon 
traditional or informational citation.

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:28.448
[bird chirps]

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:32.326
In this way, the expansion and 
liberation she describes in her materials

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:35.776
become a mode of resistance 
through creativity,

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:38.091
through pushing writing 
in the digital age.

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:39.191
[bird chirp]

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:44.055
To evaluate the power of such pushing,
consider one final reference to YouTube:

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:47.752
a video entitled 
YouTube copyright school.

00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:52.851
(YouTube video narrator) Oh Russell, your 
reuse of Lumpy’s content is clever,

00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:56.351
but did you get permission for it?
Mashups or remixes of content

00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:59.531
may also require permission
from the original copyright owner,

00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:02.189
depending on whether or 
not the use is a fair use.

00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:04.621
[extremely rapid speech] In the United 
States, copyright allows for the fair use

00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:06.611
of copyrighted material under 
certain limited circumstances

00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.271
without prior permission from the owner. 
Under the law, determinations of fair use

00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:11.671
take into account the purpose and 
character of the use, the nature of the

00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:13.981
copyrighted work, the amount and 
substantiality of the work use in relation

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.561
to the work as a whole, and the effect 
of the use upon the potential market

00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:18.641
for the copyrighted work. Other 
jurisdictions may have similar copyright

00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:20.851
provisions protecting fair use or fair 
dealing. If you are uncertain as to

00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:22.604
whether a specific use qualifies
as a fair use,

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.446
you should consult a qualified
copyright attorney

00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:28.451
(Narrator) [rapidly] I decided to use
the excerpt from YouTube copyright school

00:13:28.461 --> 00:13:31.031
[normal pace] because it's so rich
with irony.

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:35.533
Listen to the clip and you hear an 
example of how not to use multimedia.

00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:39.554
Too much typing and noise, 
and it’s hard to focus.

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:44.553
The pacing of the typed display, 
the pharmaceutical disclaimer voiceover,

00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.917
the banging and clanging 
all combine to say,

00:13:48.013 --> 00:13:52.151
pay no attention to the way 
you use the materials of others.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:55.989
In fact, don’t even try it.

00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:58.171
How to respond?

00:13:58.312 --> 00:14:00.892
