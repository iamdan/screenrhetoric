00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.110 line:1
[sound of a motor starting]

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.173 line:1
[sound of motor turning]

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.170 line:1
[sound of bit scraping plastic]

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.929
[live music playing; crowd sounds]

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:44.336
(Narrator) Point one, the prosumer 
is personal.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:50.144
I'm drifting back to 1974, 
to my dad's sabbatical,

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:54.316
when we put sediment traps in lakes 
up and down the west coast.

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:55.879
[lathing sounds; crowd sounds]

00:00:55.942 --> 00:00:59.752
My dad invented a sediment trap 
with a device for marking time.

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:04.478
The intervalometer would periodically 
drop a layer of Teflon powder

00:01:04.478 --> 00:01:06.138
in the collection tube.

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.104
We would place the traps in lakes,

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:14.104
then return years later to retrieve them 
to study the sediment.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460
[live music plays; crowd sounds]

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:19.156
The prosumer is about boundaries,

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:23.156
or, really about how boundaries 
can be metaphors for emergence.

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:25.192
[live music; scraping sounds]

00:01:25.348 --> 00:01:30.416
As Heidegger reminds us, "a boundary 
is not [that at which] something stops...

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.320
a boundary is that from which something 
begins its essential unfolding."

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.135
[live music plays softly]

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.820
Point two: The prosumer shapes materials.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Three years later, one high-school summer,
I built intervalometers,

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:54.475
working the lathe, engaging the motor, 
easing the bits into plastic.

00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:56.578 line:1
[scraping sounds; live music plays softly]

00:01:56.674 --> 00:02:01.264 line:1
I remember the steady circling, 
the making-by-taking-away.

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:08.713
I bought my first antique bike 
with the lathe money, a ‘50s cruiser.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:11.656
It probably weighed sixty pounds.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.789
It folded in half on a hill 
a few years later.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:18.865
I should have known better.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.598
I was taught to love machines, to care for
them, to find an engine leak by the smell—

00:02:27.616 --> 00:02:33.066
the antifreeze sweet or the 
almost toasty edge of burning oil.

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:34.388
[live music plays]

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.080
I was taught to feel them

00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:39.264
[sound of bird chirping] to listen.

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.381
[live music plays softly; bird chirping;
indistinct conversation]

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.139
(Soft voice in background) I don't think
I've ever had closure with Pine Point.

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:50.433
I always, I always feel sad when I. . . .

00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:54.107
(Narrator) That bike crank 
was wrong for a long time.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:59.085
It needed lubricating, rebuilding. 
It needed attention.

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:01.998
[music playing]

00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:04.262
The prosumer is concrete.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:07.072
It cracks like metal under stress.

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.649
It shapes something out of nothing 
and makes interventions through time,

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:16.896
collecting what is offered 
by the winds and the tides.

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:19.146
[music plays]

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.976
I'm talking about a making, wrought 
through layers

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.079
from binary-switching to coded
collections of objects

00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:30.510
to moving images like these,

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:36.669
making statements that sound much 
like heart valve closing and opening

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:44.530 line:1
or painting on cave wall or words 
scratched on tablet with graphite

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:53.240 line:1
wrapped in wood dipped in finish 
and pressed with its value—2B.

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:59.996 line:1
[live music plays; sounds of scraping;
a 2-stroke engine soft in the distance]

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:05.519 line:1
We pencil in our timelines, tracing, 
tracking, making the report,

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:08.575
the resume, profile essay

00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:10.244
[sound of a 2-stroke engine]

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.229
sort out the sequences and 
try to bind them together:

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.714
"I'm a bio major. I'm business.
I'm poli-sci."

00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:20.641
(woman's voice in background) Good
morning, Roy, how are you?

00:04:20.687 --> 00:04:22.748
Together, we take up the instrument,

00:04:22.748 --> 00:04:28.018
squeeze its laminated length between 
fingers and pour language until. . . .

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.369
[crowd cheering; live music plays]

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:35.658
The prosumer becomes a metaphor 
for all meaning-making

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:40.449
where, as Andrew Pickering reminds us,
"the center of gravity lies

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.479
at the intersection of human
and material agency."

00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:47.763
(unknown voice) Long time
[music plays; scraping of plastic]

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.749
(Narrator) Point three: the prosumer 
works in every mode.

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:57.272
The way ideas flow in rivulets 
up a windshield in the rain,

00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:02.475
droplets lifted back toward 
source by motion forward.

00:05:03.248 --> 00:05:09.742
The labor of the prosumer is craft and 
the logic sparks across darkened splits.

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:14.723
Hydraulic tensioners on a 
timing chain dampen sound;

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:19.064
pure metal sings a higher pitch.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.360
[live music plays]

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:25.019 line:1
What happens when the screen
becomes the space for composing?

00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:29.308 line:1
Then word becomes one
among many modes,

00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:32.654 line:1
then computing becomes performing.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.215
The zoom tool translates layers,

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:38.176
[live music plays, gaining intensity]

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:42.325
the smallest granules become the scale
through which we witness the world.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.817
[rapid guitar notes gaining intensity]

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:49.403
Then, zoomed out, the sediment 
is the memory of the earth.

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:55.806
It's best not to be measured by what 
we’re called, but by what we do.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.999
[breathing sounds 
through SCUBA respirator]

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:03.296
Keith Sawyer says our making must be 
not too rigid, but not too loose:

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:08.663
"the critical balance for innovation 
is 'at the edge of chaos.’"

00:06:08.947 --> 00:06:09.947
[live music plays]

00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:14.551
Point four: the prosumer 
pulls like memory.

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:16.100
[SCUBA sounds; live music]

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.180
The theory is the smell of bread, maybe 
ginger-tinged or yeasty at least,

00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:28.843
warm from the oven, because making 
is also reaching backwards.

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:36.516
We're all intervalometers within streams 
of sediment gathered from sounds

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.920
like stones or words like iron 
gone ferric in rusted bearings.

00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.671
[live music; SCUBA sounds]

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:49.292
Prosumer time is not just 
left to right, but up and down.

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:51.328
[rapid guitar picking]

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:56.855
It’s a blending that ceases to be 
sequence and becomes instead space,

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:03.089
playing out like sand 
plying and flowing, alluvial,

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:07.657
slow combing, for a moment--forgotten.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.765
[bubbles underwater; live music]

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:15.803
Final point/first point: the prosumer 
has nothing to prove.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:19.909
As Nietzsche tells us, "we believe
that we know

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:25.540
something about things themselves
when we speak of trees, colors, snow;

00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:30.297
and yet we possess nothing 
but metaphors for things."

00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.077
[bubbles, SCUBA sounds; music]

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:35.926
When we recognize the makings 
of thought in the material world,

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:42.616
linear time begins to loop into 
thing and event, noun and verb.

00:07:44.022 --> 00:07:47.148
The prosumer no longer 
asks us to stake a claim.

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:50.045
[plastic scraping; indistinct voices;
music]

00:07:50.316 --> 00:07:53.956
When the blossoms are coming, 
we feel their forward turning—

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:59.874
the dogwood bud a capsuled blast of 
papered thought waiting to unfold.

00:08:00.243 --> 00:08:01.243
[crowd sounds]

00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:07.973
We compose because we, too, are
turning: the soil, the eye toward flower,

00:08:08.062 --> 00:08:09.442
[indistinct voices]

00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:12.401
making arrays in the face of the abyss.

00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:14.625
[voices talking]

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.260
Let the value of field one be performing.

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:21.645
Let field two be time.

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:24.657
(Unknown voice) Oh they've been here
for a long. . . .

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.990
(Narrator) Let the value of our field
be becoming.

00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:30.873
[music; plastic scraping]

00:08:31.016 --> 00:08:32.606
(Second voice) 'Till the summer

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.695
[music fades out; crickets chirping;
plastic scraping]

00:08:36.022 --> 00:08:37.802
[crowd cheering]

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:41.795
(Second voice) Are you gonna be one
of the ones that puts the lights out?

00:08:41.892 --> 00:08:42.932
(Third voice) Me too

00:08:42.982 --> 00:08:44.152
(Fourth voice) So cool.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.019
(Third voice) Talked to Lynn she's gonna
be here too, so there'll be three of us

00:08:48.113 --> 00:08:50.183
(Fourth voice) Wow, that was so beautiful.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:53.784
(Third voice) It's been very nice of
you to give me the time and uh. . . .

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:56.461
(Fourth voice) Oh that's amazing

00:08:56.605 --> 00:08:58.315
[sound of water flowing]

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.620
Beautiful. So exciting. Thank you 
for letting me record it.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.895
[water flowing; plastic scraping]

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:13.371
Um, I like, it really feels so tribal.
Like so, so elemental. So human.

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:17.101
[soft jazz music playing; plastic
scraping]

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.640 line:1
