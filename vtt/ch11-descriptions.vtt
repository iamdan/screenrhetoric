citing decisions. . . . Different authors

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:08.265 line:1

Who, What, How, When, Where, Why.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.185
The scan is overlaid with imagery of a
fisherman walking through a meadow.

00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:40.273 line:1

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:09.436 line:1
this one. I felt as though the
"everything" needed to be EPIC

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:15.105 line:1
So I searched YouTube for
"COOL SPACE EXPLOSIONS"

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:19.496

interpretation of the text that requires
reading, watching and listening, but,

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.409 line:1
more important, the limits and horizons
that particular material conditions

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:27.329 line:1
in digital environments
make possible for imaginative texts.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.627 line:1

00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:44.478 line:1
of the heaps of already existent

A cursor begins to type: When composers
use multiple modes as tools for thinking

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:34.276
rather than just to visually illustrate
a completed script, they actually

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:42.586
generate new meaning. Creation of a
digital video then can become much more

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:47.266
than an act
of "translation" or transcription. . . .

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:55.143 line:1
Compositing and new recursivity . . . are
also critical cognitive experiences. . . .

Title on screen:
Last Metaphor: Resistance.

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.407 line:1
A cursor types: Only the humanities and
social science articles . . . contained

00:10:04.407 --> 00:10:14.755 line:1
reporting verbs characterizing the source
as unreliable (e.g., fail, overlook,

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:21.455 line:1
exaggerate, or ignore). This is
attributed to the "more disputational

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:25.455 line:1
style of argument" found
in the soft knowledge fields.

00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:37.739 line:1
The screen fades to white, then a cursor
types: The current model of digital

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:45.879 line:1
video composing as a sequential series
of temporally-discrete steps is predicated

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:53.129 line:1
on the logic of old media and, thus, may
no longer be sufficient to account for

00:10:53.129 --> 00:11:02.309 line:1
the new media composing processes
that emerge with new media interfaces.

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.471 line:1

Craft criticism . . . foregrounds textual
production while backgrounding textual

00:12:18.818 --> 00:12:25.882 line:1
interpretation. . . . Craft criticism uses
methods of production to examine the ways

00:12:25.882 --> 00:12:34.082 line:1
imaginative literature operates—and how
it can help its authors and audience

00:12:34.082 --> 00:12:39.675 line:1
members engage critically with the
cultural environment that surrounds them.

00:12:48.092 --> 00:12:51.542 line:1
The screen fills with a video showing
an animated sea otter.

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:54.858 line:1
