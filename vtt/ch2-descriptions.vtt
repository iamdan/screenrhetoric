00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
Title on screen: Happening Scholarship:
A Response to "The Red Wheelbarrow"

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.210
Daniel Anderson UNC-Chapel Hill
iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.980
Typing: The Red Wheelbarrow

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.080
So much depends
upon

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.150
a red wheel
barrow

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:14.588
In the lower left, a thumbnail video
shows a man talking and a caption:

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:16.924
Professor Geoffrey Sirc,
University of Minnesota

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.739
Typing continues: glazed with rain
water

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.839
beside the white
chickens.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.493 line:1
An excerpt from the article "Resisting
Entropy" shows on screen.

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:35.923 line:1
A cursor types in the lower right:
a red wheel barrow

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:37.219 line:1
glazed with rain
water

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:42.776 line:1
In the lower right, a browser
appears. A search is entered

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.466 line:1
and the word blot is highlighted.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:50.046 line:1
In the lower left, a cursor types: The
opening is based upon a rhetorical trick,

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:52.596 line:1
a question left hanging.
"So much" of what?

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.064 line:1
A grey ribbon appears across the
bottom of the screen

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:01.474 line:1
An eraser moves over the grey ribbon
revealing text: "so much depends /"

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:04.068 line:1
gestures vaguely, then lands with a thud
upon upon.

00:01:05.404 --> 00:01:08.544
An image of a laptop appears; the
laptop screen shows a red guitar.

00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:10.814
Hands in front of the guitar hold
a cell phone.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:14.341 line:1
A browser shows an article: Modern
American Poetry On "The Red Wheelbarrow"

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:17.953 line:1
Phrases in the article are highlighted:
working class; after the rain

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:21.343
The image with the laptop is panned up
to show a scene outside a window

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:23.883 line:1
Outside the window a chicken and
a garden appear

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:27.318 line:1
In the upper right, thumbnail video
of Geoff Sirc appears.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:32.433
Text appears at the top of the video:
I love the red on the new cover design

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.714 line:1
Opaque imagery showing a chicken
appears on the lower left

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:40.443 line:1
Opaque raindrops appear as a layer on
top of the video

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.040 line:1
Opaque clouds move as a layer over
the surface of the video

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:49.181 line:1
An image with header information from
an e-mail message appears

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:53.668
In the right half of the video, an opaque
image of the author speaking appears

00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:57.333
A scanned page shows the title of a
book: Ambient Rhetoric

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.953 line:1
A passage from the book page appears:
Rhetoric has a material dimension, and

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.513 line:1
it is an embodied and embedded practice.
Rhetoric is an emergent result of

00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:08.213 line:1
environmentally situated and interactive
engagements, redolent of a world that

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:10.684 line:1
affects us, that persuades us
prior to symbolicity.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:16.069 line:1
Geoff Sirc appears in the upper left;
the video is resized, then fades out.

00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:22.493 line:1
Opaque beneath a layer of text, the author
appears speaking in a lecture hall.

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.892 line:1
Windows stacked on a laptop screen
appear; the top image shows a laptop.

00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:33.402 line:1
The image is panned to show a 
scene outside of a window.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:37.142 line:1
The image is panned back to show
the laptop.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:44.447 line:1
An image showing a projector and a laptop
comes forward.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:52.598 line:1
An image showing a red guitar and hands
holding a cell phone comes forward.

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:56.058 line:1
Opaque clouds move over the top layer
of the entire video.

00:02:57.438 --> 00:03:00.678 line:1
An image of two hands, one rubbing the
other, comes forward.

00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:03.288 line:1
An image of a field of wheat
comes forward.

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.138 line:1
The cursor cycles through the stacked
video windows.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.740 line:1
The image with the guitar and cell phone
comes forward.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.340
The image with a scene outside a window
comes forward and is made opaque.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.189 line:1
Beneath the window scene, the hand begins
strumming the guitar.

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.299 line:1
The image of hands is moved to the top
and made opaque.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.180 line:1
The image of wheat is moved to the top
and made opaque.

00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:46.324 line:1
The image of a projector and a laptop
is moved to the top and made opaque.

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:49.881 line:1
Text appears on screen; a phrase is
highlighted: cut up into a series of

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:53.671 line:1
brief, contiguous fragments, which we
shall call lexias. The lexia will include

00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:56.401 line:1
sometimes a few words, sometimes
several sentences.

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.725
On the screen, images are cycled: wheat,
hands, a projector, a guitar.

00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:11.662
Beneath the images, the author is faintly
visible, singing in the lecture hall.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.230
Images are cycled and blended: moving
hands, a red guitar, the author singing.

00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.941 line:1
A scanned article appears; a phrase is
highlighted: This is so limited,

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.931 line:1
it's unbearable.

00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:32.087 line:1
A scanned passage from an article appears;
a pencil highlights a phrase: One of the

00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:36.077 line:1
subtexts of Composition as a Happening is
the realization that art criticism

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:40.287 line:1
in general offers more compelling theory
than Composition's canon, particularly

00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:43.157 line:1
(in this case) in relation to
the sublime.

00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:56.838 line:1
Images are cycled and mixed: a hand
strumming a guitar, the author singing.

00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:04.948 line:1
A search box that is part of a PDF file
appears; the file shows a book cover: S/Z

00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:07.698 line:1
A term is typed in the search box: layer;
a page appears

00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:11.338 line:1
The page is cropped and a passage is
highlighted: Analytically, connotation

00:05:11.338 --> 00:05:15.358 line:1
is determined by two spaces: a sequential
space, a series of orders, a space subject

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:19.308 line:1
to the successivity of sentences, in which
meaning proliferates by layering; and

00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:23.128 line:1
an agglomerative space, certain areas of
the text correlating other meanings

00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:27.108 line:1
outside the material text and, with them,
forming "nebulae" of signifieds.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.430 line:1
Another passage appears with a highlighted
phrase: a textuality inflected more

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.180 line:1
by adjudication than imagination.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.959 line:1
Images are cycled: moving hands,
wheat, a projector.

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:50.659 line:1
Typing appears, and then moves up the
screen: English Composition as a Happening

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.749 line:1
is Student Text as Blue Balloon. The
typing moves up out of the video frame

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:59.866
Images cycle and mix on screen

00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:16.148
The typing text reappears, moving down
the video frame: Where is the place

00:06:16.148 --> 00:06:19.568
for spiritual intensification in
Mainstream Composition's curriculum?

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.729
Multiple layers of blended imagery
play out on screen:

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.599
A projector and laptop, a hand strumming
a guitar, moving hands, wheat.

00:06:36.142 --> 00:06:41.482 line:1
Beneath opaque images, the author appears,
arms outstretched, singing.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:50.208 line:1
Opaque hands massage each other blended
with wheat, the guitar, the author.

00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.961 line:1
A grey ribbon appears in the lower screen;
an eraser reveals text beneath the ribbon:

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.621 line:1
Even in the most radically challenging
modernist art, there is an aesthetic,

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:05.611 line:1
a sense of formal interest,
a shimmering sheen.

00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:21.739 line:1
Images cycle and mix on screen: the author
singing, a hand strumming a guitar.

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:27.929 line:1
At the bottom of the video, a list of
works cited scrolls through sources

00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:39.148 line:1
Images cycle and mix on screen

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:51.837 line:1
The images disappear.
Across the desktop is text:

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:54.087
This machine performs
critique with compassion.

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:58.086
At the top of the screen, the cursor
clicks a menu that reads "Stop Recording."
