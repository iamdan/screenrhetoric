00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.755
(Male narrator) In this piece, I show 
how multimedia invites us

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.093
to move from concrete to abstract,

[western-themed music plays]

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.883
opening avenues for 
emergent interpretation.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:17.624
I also experiment with a mode of 
response that recognizes

00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:20.254
some of the limits 
of critique and closure.

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:25.420
Critique can be competitive, 
exclusionary, banal.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.175
Closure can lead us to overlook
the generosity of the world

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:34.238
around us, including the world 
of the texts that we study.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:41.139 line:1
Practicing a mode of alt-scholarship, 
I created a response to this poem

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:44.710 line:1
scrolling on the screen: 
"A Blessing," by James Wright.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:49.287 line:1
The poem is set off a rural highway 
near Rochester, Minnesota.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:54.317 line:1
It is about two companions who stumble 
across a pair of horses in a meadow.

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:58.557 line:1
The poem suggests a bond 
between human and animal

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:02.677 line:1
and among humans, an emotional connection.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.931 line:1
This emotional connection is often lost 
among the logic of academic closure.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.307 line:1
But affect is linked to abstraction 
and audio-visual registers,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.670 line:1
which makes multimodal production 
a space for emergent composing.

00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:23.837 line:1
The works we study are rich and 
ambiguous, unfolding like flowers.

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:26.493 line:1
Why not our responses?

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.544 line:1
These kinds of responses 
can create new subjectivities.

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:35.534 line:1
"A Blessing" depicts a coming-together, as
the speaker and his companion

00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:37.749 line:1
connect with two Indian ponies.

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:41.493 line:1
And the poem extends that 
human-animal connection with a metaphor

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.491 line:1
that transcends the subject/object 
divide and generates

00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:48.171 line:1
a new sense of self, 
at one with the world.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:52.165 line:1
"Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped 
out of my body

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:54.588 line:1
I would break / Into blossom."

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:01.242
On a Thursday morning, 
I worked up a response

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:03.852
that plays with layering, 
cameras, and screens.

00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:08.014
I started with a YouTube 
clip that depicts horses.

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:11.627
I began bringing together verbal 
and visual representations,

Here, we have a typical instance 
of a camera filming a subject,

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:41.883
with the added layering of a reflection of
the laptop on the surface of the guitar.

00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:47.647
At the same time I used Snapz 
to capture the Photo Booth application

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:49.427
recording on the screen.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.860
I used a transparency application 
to layer the YouTube video

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.770
over the Photo Booth application 
as it filmed the guitar.

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:01.365
Snapz captured a composite of Photo Booth 
filming and the YouTube video playing.

I also captured a scrolling video
of the text of the poem.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.549
I brought all these materials 
into a video editor,

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.898
made a few adjustments, and 
uploaded my response to YouTube.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.733
The process compressed a couple of hours

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.533

I enjoyed mixing horse imagery with music

00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:06.871
as a response to the poem, 
but was not satisfied.

00:04:07.272 --> 00:04:11.272
I wanted a response driven more 
by affect and companionship,

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:13.375
something more abstract.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.360
I started over with this footage 
of drag racer Don Prudhomme,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.333
captured just after his competitor's car 
broke into pieces at over 200 mph.

00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:26.393
Fortunately, the other racer was okay,

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:28.593
but Prudhomme did not 
know this at the moment.

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:32.556
I combined this clip with

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.960
a time that featured what 
might be called a cherished rivalry

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.376
between Prudhomme and 
fellow racer Tom McEwen.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.600
The original translation 
with horses was too literal—

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.790
horse reference to horse image.

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:53.186
I wanted to feel and share the 
generative compassion in the poem.

00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:59.510
Taking another tack, I created this 
experiment in affective response.
