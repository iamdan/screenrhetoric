00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Title, black text on a white background:
The Blessing of Rescuing Critique,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.020
Daniel Anderson, @iamdan.
The title text fades out.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.130
A passage shows across the top
of the screen: Suspicious reading

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.580
inscribes
itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.840
equipped with distinct qualities: distance
rather than closeness; guardedness rather

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280
than openness; aggression rather than
submission; superiority rather than

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.570
reverence; attentiveness rather than
distraction; exposure rather than

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.630
tact. . . . The danger . . . is less
its potential brutality than

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.783
the threat of banality.

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:31.983
Wild horses appear across the bottom
of the video.

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.003
The horse imagery fades out.
The passage on screen fades out.

00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:40.170
One line at a time, the poem "A Blessing"
scrolls at the bottom of the screen

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.400
New text appears: What drives
[a hermeneutics of suspicion] is the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.270
conviction that appearances are deceptive,
that texts do not gracefully relinquish

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.950
their meanings, that manifest content
shrouds darker, more unpalatable truths.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.660
It is a mode of interpretation that adopts
a distrustful attitude toward texts

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.070
in order to draw out meanings or
implications that are not intended and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.530
that remain inaccessible to their authors
as well as to ordinary readers.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:06.644
A new passage appears: Such an
orientation has clear affinities with the

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:10.374
burgeoning interest in affect. One of the
distinguishing marks of works of art,

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:13.954
after all, is their ability to inspire
intense responses, inchoate emotions,

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:17.444
quasi-visceral passions, working and
worming their way into our minds and

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.214
bodies. Art is the quintessential
mood-altering substance.

00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:22.948
"A Blessing" scrolls at the bottom
of the screen.

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:26.158
New text appears: A critical inquiry
involves some manner of courage

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:29.318
or audacity. It is also why such a
critical practice opens up a new

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.808
possibility for elaborating the subject
or what [Foucault] sometimes calls

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:36.518
creating a new subjectivity, one that
would by definition maintain an uncertain

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:40.358
relation to existing terms of legitimacy
and intelligibility, at least at first.

00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:44.643
New text appears: The object of study is
no longer an object. A generous reading

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:48.623
is always, in part, a reading of ourselves
reading. The thought it produces is never

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:51.983
transferable, recognizable, paraphrasable,
applicable, expoundable, or

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:55.603
illustratableâ€”meaning that it cannot
be detached either from the text itself

00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:57.323
or from the moment of reading.

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:03.315
A folder window containing files appears.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.124
A video appears with a title:
Wild Horses of Nevada.

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:13.964
Wild horses appear, grazing
and gathering in scrub brush.

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.286 line:1
A figure holding a red guitar appears.

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:29.356 line:1
The figure strums the guitar.

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:35.998 line:1
On the surface of the guitar is reflected
a scene outside a window and a laptop.

00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:48.222 line:1
The laptop screen appears. It blends
imagery of a man in a cowboy hat,

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:51.202 line:1
a windmill, and the red guitar.
A camera program counts down,

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:54.792 line:1
reflected on the guitar with wild horses
and the man in the cowboy hat.

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.501 line:1
Opaque windmill blades rotate on screen.
Opaque horses move over the guitar.

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.431 line:1
The figure strums.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:20.336 line:1
An audio visualizer appears.

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:24.336 line:1
The colors in the visualizer shift
and spike.

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.429 line:1
A video on YouTube appears showing
a figure holding a red guitar.

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.469 line:1
The video show blended imagery of a man in
a cowboy hat, a windmill, and the guitar.

00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:47.193 line:1
In the video, the figure strums
the guitar.

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:03.332 line:1
The screen fades to white.

00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:07.092 line:1
An image appears showing a man in a dark
blue shirt. His face fills the screen,

00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:09.542 line:1
grimacing. Imposed on the image is text:
OH MY GOD.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.992 line:1
The image cuts to a montage of drag
racing imagery.

00:04:11.992 --> 00:04:15.762 line:1
The man in the blue shirt reappears,
hunched over. Text shows over the imagery:

00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:17.642 line:1
HOW BAD IS HE?

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:25.224 line:1
A montage appears with drag racers,
ights, and a finger poised over a switch.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.387 line:1
Imagery shows mechanics working,
and then two male figures conversing.

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:43.864 line:1
The imagery fades out leaving a white
swatch projected on a wall and a chair.

00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:51.402 line:1
Opaque text is projected on the wall:
Rochester your secret's safe with me.

00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:00.281 line:1
A figure in a white shirt steps into
the frame and sits on the chair.

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.281 line:1
He holds a red guitar. On his shirt,
imagery showing drag racers is projected.

00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.351 line:1
The text of "A Blessing" scrolls
in the lower right.

00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:16.271 line:1
The figure strums the guitar.

00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.891 line:1
Drag racing imagery plays over the figure
and the guitar.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.110 line:1
Men roll a dragster to a starting line.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.380 line:1
"A Blessing" scrolls: Just off the highway
to Rochester, Minnesota,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.530 line:1
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.410 line:1
In the lower right appears a thumbnail
video with a figure hunched over a laptop.

00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:48.758 line:1
"A Blessing" scrolls: And the eyes of
those two Indian ponies

00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:50.018 line:1
Darken with kindness.

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:55.802 line:1
A dragster launches from
the starting line.

00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:59.802 line:1
Cars race across the screen, projected
on the figure and the red guitar.

00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:06.432 line:1
"A Blessing" scrolls: They have come
gladly out of the willows

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.092 line:1
To welcome my friend and me.

and converse.

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.539 line:1
"A Blessing" scrolls: They ripple tensely,
they can hardly contain their happiness

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.699 line:1
That we have come.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.929 line:1
The figure strums as imagery plays over
his shirt and the guitar.

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:50.406 line:1
"A Blessing" scrolls: They bow shyly as
wet swans. They love each other.

00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:52.146 line:1
There is no lonliness like theirs.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:58.185 line:1

the slenderer on in my arms,

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:26.096
For she has walked over to me

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.256
A dragster spins out of control, sliding
and spinning down the track.

00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:35.041

And the light breeze moves me to caress
her long ear

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:02.996
The figure plays guitar. On his shirt is
projected

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:05.746

HOW BAD IS HE?

"A Blessing" scrolls: Suddenly I realize

00:08:24.193 --> 00:08:26.523
That if I stepped out of my body
I would break

00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:27.613
Into blossom.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:36.446
The figure strums as imagery of a
mangled dragster plays over his shirt.

00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:47.675

00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:50.035
blue shirt. On the image, text appears:
OH MY GOD.

00:08:50.035 --> 00:08:52.375
The image freezes.

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:58.166
The figure with the guitar moves, shifting
the frozen image as the screen zooms out.
