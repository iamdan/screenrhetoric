(Geoff Sirc) So, and this is like Longinus
you know

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:13.307 line:1
we don’t want to persuade people
when we write.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.522 line:1
What we want to do is blow their head off,

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:16.948 line:1
and you know I get that.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:18.147 line:1
We want to amaze them,

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.886 line:1
and so that leads Longinus

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:21.926 line:1
to talking about the rhetorical figures.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.700 line:1

Longinus.

And those short snippets that lead to
the sublime.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.659 line:1
One of my favorites snippets is

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.989 line:1
“The Red Wheelbarrow,” by
William Carlos Williams.

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:41.228 line:1
The poem has been called
a Rorschach’s blot

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:45.228 line:1
for the way its opening stanza evokes
the whole metaphysical project.

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:49.571 line:1
What is it that depends? Anything.

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.167 line:1
And everything.

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:57.432 line:1
The structure of the poem
whets our anticipation

upon white space

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.810
Then the piece pulls back with particulars

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.847
that border on the banal.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.650
It’s driven the critics nuts.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.925 line:1
Some say, the poem is about labor.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:19.775 line:1
Some say, the modern condition.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.000 line:1
But my favorite: a certain cast of light.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:26.025
(Geoff Sirc) You know the way
that I would do, you know

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:27.128
a happening classroom,

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:29.852
because you know, I mean students come in
and immediately

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:32.241
it’s a different atmosphere. 
That's what you want

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:34.702
You want to just change the
atmosphere in the room

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:38.352
so that they’re not breathing the same old
college-expectation atmosphere.

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:43.638
It’s a different climate and, you know,
ah, so, so there.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.326
(Narrator) Viewing the poem as about
a cast of light

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:50.556
and thinking about atmosphere leads us to

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:54.076
the theoretical portion of this
alternative response.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:59.668
Happenings can’t be uncoupled
from their space and time.

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:06.541
They are atmospheric events,
like the weather, like compositions.

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:10.182
