["Your Hand in Mine" by Explosions in the
Sky begins to play very softly]

00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:25.963
(Computer-generated voice) See there is 
this thing called writing.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.020
And it’s great.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
[soft guitar notes]

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:33.531
(Male narrator) I love writing. But I’m 
supposed to be here to talk about data.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.763
Writing, ah, I mean data is so cool.

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:40.483
Look at how it helps us make sense 
of something like an election.

00:00:40.788 --> 00:00:43.828
Um. Okay. Maybe I should rethink that.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:49.199
The word out of the 2016 presidential 
election was the death of data,

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:51.208
and the rise of stories.

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:53.673
[music plays quietly; soft guitar notes]

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:57.469
(Computer-generated voice) It's not that 
politics don't matter,

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:03.697
but writing, writing that's
a human activity.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.844
[Indistinct background conversation]

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:09.080
(Narrator) I don’t know. 
Death is so serious.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.330
At most, maybe data just had a bad day.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.572
And if the point is to 
tell stories and write our lives,

00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:18.606
well, data is doing that even as we speak.

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:21.260
And it’s kind of already political.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.706
And it’s kind of taken on a life of its 
own. Here it is built into an assignment.

00:01:25.843 --> 00:01:27.013
[A computer chime rings]

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.120
And here is someone using it 
for scholarship in the humanities,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.000
telling stories with it.

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:34.728
[Soft guitar and drums]

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:38.081
And it’s really kind of 
interesting to play around with.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.119
We used this spreadsheet.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.249
It was surprisingly easy to 
gather an archive of tweets.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:46.393
And then we could think about 
the terms we might use

00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:48.313
to make sense of the many tweets.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:53.123
We learned to think about data and tell 
some stories—almost feels like a campfire.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.965
And look what the machine 
put together for us.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:02:00.035
It’s so cool, all referenced 
with metadata and sortable.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:05.667
And watch this, we can run the tweets 
through a sentiment analysis algorithm.

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:07.126
So cool.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.864
[soft music; typing]

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:12.829
(Computer-generated voice) I don't think 
we are talking about the same thing.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:18.305
Sometimes you still need to draw a line.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.479
[Soft guitar notes play quietly]

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:27.863
(Narrator) I'm with you, probability 100.

00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:31.483
That computational analysis 
of postruth is bogus.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.669
Look at those tweets. Debates 
on the topic. Dystopia.

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.431
A wake up call. Posttruth is 
no positive development.

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.869
[train horn]

00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:42.058

[crossing bells, train horn]

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:47.075
(Narrator) That's a train horn. They 
were amazing network makers

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.825
in the analog days. 
Their horns sound lonesome.

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:54.956
(Computer-generated voice) I know that. 
I have access to all the databases.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:58.966
(Narrator) It's cool that they run in 
Portland right through the town,

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:00.741
down by the river.

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.579
(Computer-generated voice) Yeah. 
Their horns sound lonesome.

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:07.367
(Narrator) Anyway, back to the tweets.

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:10.747
We got about 1,000 of them
cleaned up in the spreadsheet.

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:14.674
And then we started assigning 
meaning to them—metadata.

00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:17.879
We all worked on the 
same spreadsheet, filling in data.

00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:22.077
And then our spreadsheet gave us these 
tools to computationally assist our coding

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.300
The tweets weren't positive, obviously.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:29.542
We only found a 
positive sentiment 5.3% of the time.

00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:32.280
[soft train sounds and music]

00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:36.095
(Computer-generated voice) I still don’t 
think we are on the same page.

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:39.145
I’m talking shady characters 
and fuzzy operations,

00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:42.351
deep intrigue, the stuff of storytelling.

00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.894
(Narrator) Oh, this is fuzzy, and shady.

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:49.347
Our 5.3 percent is just one study, 
but it feels right.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.758
Come on, just between me and you:

00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:54.888
it’s a lot of counting, interpreting, 
and representing.

00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:59.919
Maybe we can focus on the stories coming 
out of that process. Let’s look at those.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.977
(Male student speaking) I have chosen
to mark as well as I can

00:04:03.017 --> 00:04:06.357
the emotions of each one within certain
broad categories,

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:11.827
the temporal focus,
when is the tweet referring to,

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:15.973
and does the tweet include a call to 
action no matter how big or how small.

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:18.337
[Music plays quietly]

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:22.841
(Narrator) So, I asked everyone to share
their discoveries from working with data.

00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:25.411
Really, it’s pretty much like writing.

00:04:25.622 --> 00:04:29.162
It’s framing things, asking 
questions, representing ideas.

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:31.901
And trying to make change in the world.

00:04:31.992 --> 00:04:34.412
In fact, the best part 
of the experience

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:35.582
[train horn and bells]

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:38.262
is the way it helps us question 
our basic assumptions.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.319
(Female student speaking) Humans need 
to categorize everything.

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.788
That’s the only way we can 
navigate in this world.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:44.933
[electronic music]

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:47.588
But putting everything 
in boxes is problematic.

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:50.734
What happens when the object does not fit?

00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:55.522
In the action of defining lines 
for when a term is in a category

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.851
and when it’s outside 
lies a lot of judgment.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.010
Every word makes up for its own category: 
woman, sci-fi, horror, beautiful,

00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:11.727
nationality, clever, left-wing, 
truth, depression, art, etc.

00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:15.991
In the following I wish to investigate 
the three categories:

00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:21.803
human, computer, and, um,
the category, category.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:27.657
["Your Hand in Mine" plays]

00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:31.541
(Narrator) I remember my dad told me 
a story about human development.

00:05:31.954 --> 00:05:36.179
He said, much boiled down 
to accidents of eyes and ears.

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:40.674
Somehow our eyes and ears 
evolved to either side of our heads,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.585
giving us binary brains, 
with switching and signals.

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:46.934
He liked the long view.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.740
Just this week he told me things sometimes
get worse before they get better.

00:05:52.534 --> 00:05:57.370
He said, what we’ve done follows from 
that change, from that binary brain.

00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:01.868
Our sight. Our smell. 
The way we walk. Our bridges.

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:05.744
The streams of vapor 
we leave tracing the sky.

[soft guitar notes increasing
in intensity]

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.479
I once wrote some poems 
about the organic mechanic.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.669
I layered one beneath an article 
about Mac and PC characters.

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:18.737
[drums join guitars]

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:21.625
The poems were about metaphors

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:25.247
and the aesthetics and power of materials
and design in machines.

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:26.308
[Music plays]

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.510

I can tell, you bridges sing, my friend.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:35.261
