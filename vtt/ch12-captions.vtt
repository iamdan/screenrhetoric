00:00:01.994 --> 00:00:06.744
(Male narrator) What happens when you mix
memoir with music, video, and words?

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.159
You get multimedia manifesto.

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:14.714
And when you reflect through,
as well as about, media composing,

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:18.927
you get moments like these,
captured on screen.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.090
I’m searching for some sound.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.955
There’s a shared response
with the machine.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:26.185
[music begins to play]

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.985
Let’s play a YouTube clip.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:31.672
Let’s adjust this a little bit.

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:35.382
Let’s think about how to arrange
these pieces.

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:40.889
About scale and movement. Focus. Time.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:44.156
Let’s get a feel for the music.

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:45.746
For the mood.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.956 line:1
Let’s play with this image,
create what we want to say

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.866 line:1
with these materials.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:57.376
Layers, shapes, words,
that launch us into memory.

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.668
[Soft guitars play]

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.505
When I was about six,
I went to the Twelve Gates free school.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:06.245
And this was in the ‘60s.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:08.051
It was a hippie school.

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:11.501
The only rule was the teachers
couldn't tell you what to do.

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:15.821
We wandered downtown, scouring the city.

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.871
But I soon had to go to public school
and I was still just six,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.811 line:1
and the first thing I did
was say, “shit,”

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.030 line:1
and had my mouth washed out with soap.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:31.221 line:1
[distinct guitar note sounds and echoes]

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:34.936
My first question is personal.

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:39.036
What one thing would you change
about education?

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:40.558
[soft guitars]

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.760
My teaching memories start with 1993,
my first time in a computer classroom.

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:51.459
I put my PC disk in a Mac and erased
my syllabus on the first day.

00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:56.028
That accident was the warm sun on my face.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.537
The response was electric.

00:01:59.017 --> 00:02:01.617
Do you want to reformat?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.416
Just click okay.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
[soft guitars]

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:10.561
The second memory weaves together
teaching and composing beyond words.

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:15.415
We learned to layer ideas
with images, sounds, language.

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:20.155
We learned to mark up text
and talk to servers to write the web.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.770
We learned to code to help the web
write back.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:28.087
Which leads to an affirmation.

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:31.647 line:1
Digital composing is comfortable with
learning to learn,

00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:35.927 line:1
with technical play, with ephemera,
disappearance.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:37.228 line:1
[soft music plays]

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:41.529 line:1
With tweak first, theorize later.

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:46.721 line:1
With what we call emergence, that edge
where chaos and composing

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:50.746 line:1
come together as creativity plays out.

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:53.644
[an electric guitar plays steady notes]

00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.804
[a second guitar plays along]

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:02.973
[both guitars pause and echo
before the full band begins playing

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:06.442
But we still made claims and drew
conclusions:

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.922
Our thinking is like a network,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:13.632
the computer will democratize
literature, writing, education.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:16.414
This changes everything.

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:18.794
This is total disruption.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.060
And it was instantiation of theories:

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:26.184
post-structural networks,
fluid texts, shifting authors.

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:27.468
[electric guitars]

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:31.013
We saw The Electronic Word and realized,

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:37.732
"the critical/creation dichotomy auto-
matically breaks down in a digital world."

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.631
[electric guitars, drums]

00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:44.182
In the ‘90s, we were hacking away
at the web, trying to make it writable.

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:47.554
Which brings us to the do-it-yourself
attitude of the digital,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.170
the studio or shop class suited for
tweaking and turning materials,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.190 line:1
for working with hands and minds.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.463
[sparse guitar notes echo]

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.929
(T.S. Eliot) "Let us go then, you and I."

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:06.656 line:1
So my introduction to
formalized education was rough.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.302
But I still had some wonderful teachers.

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:15.012
In second grade, on another first day,
Mrs. Buchannon told me,

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:18.192
"Stick to your guns, when you think
you're right."

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:21.842 line:1
Looking past the ratty hair
and backing the new kid,

00:04:21.982 --> 00:04:25.982
she showed me that learning is about
risk and trust.

00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:28.957
[sparse guitar notes ring out]

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:33.342
In digital history, this piece on screen
is 2003,

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:35.866
and this is multimedia taking root.

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.996 line:1
This moment is a response
to programs like iMovie

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:41.506 line:1
and the lowering of technical hurdles.

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:45.506 line:1
This is the prosumer-push, full throttle.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.600 line:1
[humming sound and light guitar notes]

00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:53.195 line:1
My best class ever was
auto shop in high school.

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:58.285 line:1
My mentor, Erwin Schlaack, taught me
to recognize poetry in mechanical things.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.235
Life lessons like torque
applied to metal bolt,

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:07.185
the breaking point, the backing off,
the just right moment,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.850 line:1
which leads me to another question:

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.840 line:1
what should be our teaching philosophy?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.680 line:1
[spares guitar notes echo]

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:22.012
The digital should be a place for
experimentation,

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:24.402
a place where you can try something.

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:26.433 line:1
Who knows what will happen?

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:30.948 line:1
We all can reflect on and practice
creative response.

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:34.796 line:1
Every project should be a revelation.

00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:37.996 line:1
It's okay not to know how to do something.

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:41.694 line:1
It's okay to make mistakes.

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:46.142
When I first went to college, I brought my
Mexican mesh bag stocked for the beach:

00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:48.622
Frisbee, sandals.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.219
When I took a second crack
at a university, a teacher,

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.909
Mike Fischer, taught me to
write about ideas.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.885
I thought I'd take on deconstruction.

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:02.358
I felt like literature didn't dissolve
anything,

00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:06.567
but generated being
through insights and emotions,

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:09.697
"thoughts too deep for tears."

00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:13.461
Then I started teaching with computers
and found the bubble.

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:18.051
Here, my life memories merge
with my recollections of a field.

00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:19.731
I think of John Slatin,

00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:25.361
who taught me about texts and code,
and working with those we love.

[music builds]

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.550 line:1
We are the lab discipline
of the humanities.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.462 line:1
The place where art, music, film,
and story are cast together.

Where beliefs are created in response
to the material world.

beating in the veins and tracing it

Do not ask . . . must we always manifesto?

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:35.213
The question’s rhetorical.

This moment is now emerging.

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:42.308
Should we use this YouTube clip
we’ve found?

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:45.208
The question's rhetorical.
How could we not?

00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:48.748
It's a part of this story, the memoir,
the performance.

This is the twenty-third take
of a live improvisation.

Twenty-three takes among hundreds
of unsaved instances,

coming and going like the folding edge
of time.

was important for teaching.

Of course it is.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:36.104
But what I’ve learned is that the prosumer
is not about school.

00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:39.832
It’s about everybody making everything.

you prosume.

and what will we say as we cast
our creations into the mix.

Do we write these waves and shapes

Yes.
