(Male narrator) Mealea warned me.
Over dinner,

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:22.547
after a fabulous talk about the ways
in which artifacts are not texts,

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:25.327
or at least are not necessarily texts.

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:26.467
[music plays]

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:31.368
And the ways in which those of us want 
everything to be a text can mess things up

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:35.368
trying to make the world match what we 
want or even what we need it to be

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.338
while not recognizing 
the world for what it is.

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:42.413
We want to control the world, 
rather than be of the world.

And so Disney has its own cacophony, 
a unique soundscape that only is Disney.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:54.932
And I’m not only necessarily talking about
what may have popped into your brains:

00:00:54.932 --> 00:00:59.482
It’s a Small World, or perhaps (if you are
old enough) the Sunday night

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.966
to make the castle tip 
glow like a fallen star.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:11.818
No, I am talking about the incessant, 
relentless sales pitch of what

200 bucks for a day of theme park tickets.

27 hours at minimum wage!

[overlapping voices]

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.390
So I’m in this fucking bus 
with two dozen English teachers.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.126
Not English Professors, who are bad 
enough, but grizzled boogery middle school

00:01:57.126 --> 00:02:01.821
and high school teachers with bad 
comb-overs and thematic holiday sweaters

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:05.615
Who give you extra credit for 
bringing them cat food coupons,

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.468
and double the credit if they’re worth 
a free can of icky cat food

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:14.322
and you hope to whatever you deem holy 
that they do indeed have fifteen cats...

And the stories of Mister Whiskers padding
across the new translation of Dostoevsky

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:25.599
they are reading religiously evenings over
Earl Grey that there is a Mister Whiskers

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.599
and this isn’t a sad, quiet way 
of making ends meet

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.155
because I live in a country that thinks 
teachers aren’t professionals

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:37.355
and its okay for jocks to get the girls
and then take home all the money too

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:42.051
because business administration is much 
more important than teaching zitfaced kids

no, too easy a joke.

There’s nothing wrong
with that as an image.

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:03.672
But it’s not the image that I 
as a filmmaker wanted you to see.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:09.365
If I wanted to work in this four-by-three 
format, I would choose to work in that

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:12.585
and have, often, as many directors have.

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.876
And directors do wonderful 
movies in that format,

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:18.676
but they know they are 
working in that format,

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:23.630
so they give you the information that they
think you need in that format.
