Title: Sediment

Text: The prosumer marks the
blurring of consumption and production.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.309
But might the prosumer also represent
a new mode of composing? Lev Manovich

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.689
notes that spatialized narrative
in the twentieth century "was relegated

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.669
to 'minor' cultural forms such as comics
or technical illustrations. 'Real' culture

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.299
of the twentieth century came to speak
of linear chains, aligning itself with

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:21.719
the assembly line
of the industrial society. . . ."

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.689
What if we imagine modes that make meaning
with simultaneous arrangements and loops?

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.279
