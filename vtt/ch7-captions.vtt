[thunder sounds, then echoes]

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:13.468

[electric circuit buzzing]

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.900
[bass guitar and shaker]

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:45.304
(Male narrator) I'm here and I'm talking
about how people, ideas, and things

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:51.090
fit together. How we represent culture 
with maps or ecologies.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.265
How we render something like Flickr:

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:58.482
people, gathered in groups, 
a network of connections.

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:00.183
[bass and shaker]

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.925
Or, we look to 
the living world for models.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.549
Of this image we're told, microbes 
in the soil consume the leaf's soft tissue

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.692
and leave only the cellulose 
and lignin skeleton.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.475
The Flickr image suggests space, 
the leaf says time,

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:23.643
the slow decay paradoxically 
revealing connections.

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:25.195
[bass and shaker]

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:28.596
It's these connections 
we're about to explore.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:29.752
Let's start

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.842
[bass guitar and shaker]

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:33.022
with language.

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.571
[thunder crashing and echoing]

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:43.123
I'm here and I'm talking about flow zones,
those spaces where transformation happens,

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:46.253
the in-betweens where we 
find the breathing current.

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:48.067 line:1
[electric current sound]

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:52.934 line:1
This is old style, the focus zoomed 
smack-dab to the printed word.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.437 line:1
The truth which the poet utters can be a
approached only in terms of paradox.

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:05.568
We bring new focus now, but wow, 
that's some hard commitment

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:10.318
to the power of the written, 
or here the spoken, word.

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:15.258
Metaphors do not lie in the same plane 
or fit neatly edge to edge.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:19.853
There is a continual tilting, necessary 
overlappings,

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.159
discrepancies,

00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:24.223 line:1
contradictions.

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.277 line:1
[thunder cracking, echoing]

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.006 line:1
[bass and shaker]

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:34.477
The edges of paradox emerge with words, 
arrayed and linked to new ideas.

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:38.878
Like how the tenor of the 
metaphor makes way for its vehicle.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.557
Words cross the connotational space, 
where one idea flows into another,

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:46.730
where meaning develops.

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:50.438
In poetry we call for vehicles, red
wheelbarrows from which

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:55.068
we borrow attributes, modes of transport
that bring the associations

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:57.878
of one element 
into circuit...

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.875
[jet plane approach and flyover]

00:03:03.637 --> 00:03:04.807
with another.

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:08.664
[bass guitar and shaker]

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:14.691
(Man in blue shirt) 
Hello, I'm a Mac.

00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.071
[Man in trench coat) 
And I am no one.

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:19.523
(Narrator) I'm a Mac, I'm a PC.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:22.566
This commingling of human 
and machine reveals

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:25.436
the back and forth coursing of attributes.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.149
Virus. Spyware. Glasses. Cool shirt.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:35.497
The machine and human 
co-informing each other.

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.843
(Man in trench coat) You never saw me.

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.623
(Male in blue shirt) Never saw who?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.390
(Man in trench coat) Me, PC.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:46.335
(Narrator) The Mac or PC metaphors show 
how people, ideas, and things

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:49.065
flow together in cultural networks.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.460 line:1
The currents circulate, back and forth.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.420 line:1
A network: it's the trace left 
behind by some moving agent.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.805 line:1
It has to be traced anew by 
the passage of another vehicle,

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.411 line:1
another circulating entity.

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:14.412 line:1
The red wheelbarrow depends upon the 
bicycle and the bus driver being on time.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.495
[bass guitar and shaker]

00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:20.026
Moving entities, tracing and circulating.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.279
Fantastic detail,

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.979
Wow . . . Texture.

00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:26.162
[bass and shaker]

00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:27.850
Amazing focus.

00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:29.138
[bass and shaker]

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:30.686
My favorite color.

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:35.676
Relationships growing within flowing 
networks of red, umber, pencil.

00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:36.872
[jet approaching]

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.853
Power Cords. Power chords.

00:04:40.184 --> 00:04:41.184
[jet flyover]

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:43.146
(Man in blue shirt) Hello, I'm a Mac.

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.846
(Man in wheelchair) And I'm a PC.

00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:45.999
(Mac) I'm afraid to ask.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.589
(PC) Well, I was sitting at my desk. 
Someone walked by, carelessly tripped

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.582
over my power cord, yanked me straight 
down to the ground, bam.

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:56.205
(Mac) Yikes. Macbooks come with this 
power cord that connects magnetically,

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:58.615
so, when it gets pulled 
it just pops right off and

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:02.305
everything is just kind of thought out, 
like the tiny built in iSight camera.

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.345
(PC) My life is flashing before my eyes.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:06.485
I see a sunset in a 
field of beautiful wheat.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:08.325
(Mac) Isn't that your screensaver?

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.119
(PC) Yeah.

00:05:10.316 --> 00:05:11.066
[popping sound]

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.009
[bass and shaker]

00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:17.713
(Narrator) What follows is we find 
ourselves awash amid entities that give

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:20.520
and take shape among one another:

00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:27.447
The Shins, Kelly Clarkson, Mac Mail, 
Mastodon, Webmail,

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:36.879
copy, paste, copy, paste, 
power cords, empathy, celebrity,

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:47.794
sharing, IP, music, text, 
text editor, Justin, John, Hannah,

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:56.546
Lady Gaga, cheesy, ukulele, sun, 
dust, rolling thunder, clouds crowding

00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:02.028
circulating collections of 
people, ideas, and things.

00:06:02.604 --> 00:06:05.014
[bass guitar and shaker]

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.571
We depend on a flood...
of entities to exist.

00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:10.643
[bubbles underwater]

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:16.006
To be an actor is now at last a fully 
artificial and fully traceable gathering

00:06:17.223 --> 00:06:18.923
(Mac) Hello, I'm a Mac.

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:21.863
(Male figure) Mac has issued a 
salutation, cancel or allow?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.113
(PC) Allow. And I'm a PC.

00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:25.983
(Male) You are returning Mac's 
salutation, cancel or allow?

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:26.723
(PC) Allow.

00:06:26.743 --> 00:06:27.843
(MAC) Okay, what gives?

00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:30.203
(Male) Mac is asking a 
question, cancel or allow?

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.743
(PC) Allow. He's part of Vista, my new 
operating system. PCs have a lot of

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.173
security problems, so he asks me to 
authorize pretty much anything I do.

00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:40.678
(Narrator) The concern is that these 
networks constrain us, shape us,

00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.834
and tell us who we are.

00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:46.424
(Male) You are coming to a sad 
realization, cancel or allow?

00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:47.264
(PC) Allow.

00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:52.201
(Narrator) The gatherings threaten the 
human figure by binding us together,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.010
surrounding us with ideas and things.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.250
(Mac) Did your legal copy just grow?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.540
(PC) Yeah, you see usually PCs require 
a lot of regular maintenance,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.170
downloading security patches, virus scans.
I can't just go out there and say,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.070
hey, getting started on PC is the 
easiest thing in the world.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.970
(Mac) Whoa. That's a lot of legal copy.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.250
(PC) Watch this. PCs are now 
100% trouble free.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.600
(Mac) Look at that.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.490
(PC) That's a lot of legal copy.

00:07:16.763 --> 00:07:20.373
(Narrator) But there is also an organic 
flow, as we gather together

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:24.340
in circuit with machines,
an entity among entities,

00:07:24.494 --> 00:07:25.494
[current buzzes]

00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:29.582
conduit for streams of meaning-making
and performing action,

00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:34.052
never powerless, 
full of awareness of layerings,

00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:38.818
knowing that categories (like worlds) 
can still bring us

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:39.884
[bubbles underwater]

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:41.264
transformation.

[electric current buzzing]

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:49.205
I'm here and I'm talking about fitting in.
PC goes to Pandora and types in Shins.

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.751
The machine responds.

00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:55.734
The composition is one of mixing, 
but the zoom is way out.

00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:57.138
[music by The Shins plays]

00:07:57.213 --> 00:08:00.663
Choosing word over image 
or sound feels myopic.

00:08:00.902 --> 00:08:05.922
The composing here is one of entity in 
flowing network, not type cast,

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:07.091
[Shins music plays]

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.090

I'm talking about performing.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.240
The way the network is never 
hung up to dry, but always in motion,

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:19.462
always calling us to be composing.

00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:24.464
What is a text? What isn't? 
What is writing?

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:30.945
The paintbrush. The poet. 
The CPU. The lungs.

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:36.904
The organic mechanic typing song as 
worlds unfold in a streaming cast.

00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:40.151
Fantastic detail.

00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:42.416
What focus did you use?

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:43.946

[bass guitar and shaker]

00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:57.955
Through circulation we become, layer 
after layer, comparable and commensurable.

00:08:59.358 --> 00:09:00.178
Human.

00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:04.689
The question is not to fight against 
categories, but rather to ask:

00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:09.266
Is the category subjecting 
or subjectifying you . . . freedom

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:13.298 line:1
is getting out of a bad bondage, 
not an absence of bonds.

00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:18.518 line:1
All the world's a studio, and we are 
but performers and mechanics,

00:09:18.613 --> 00:09:23.783
transporting and fixing meaning
through each lignin layer.

00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:25.028

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:30.433
I'm here and I'm talking about the 
connotational flow, the liquid mixings

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:35.963 line:1
of sound and light, felt-like, felt like
