A video is brought forward
with a light-yellow background.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.964
The cursor takes a screenshot of the
video background.

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:11.624
The screenshot appears on screen
in an image editor.

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:14.564
The cursor uses tools to create a
light-yellow color swatch.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.204
An image with video thumbnails appears
in the editor.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.584
The image background is
filled with light yellow.

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:21.964
The cursor uses a layer palette

The cursor hovers over the thumbnails
at the top, revealing short descriptions.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.239 line:1
The cursor hovers over the thumbnails
at the bottom, revealing descriptions.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.423 line:1
The web browser slides off screen.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.963 line:1
The cursor brings forward a video
and presses play.

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.751 line:1
The video is scaled to fill the screen.

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:44.851 line:1
A browser window shows a recording of a
scene being painted with digital tools.

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.011 line:1
The window is moved to the top right.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.471 line:1

The cursor resizes and positions
the window in the top left

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.445 line:1
The video shows a singer and microphone,
and then a concert crowd.

00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.125 line:1
A browser window shows a video clip on
YouTube titled: Charles Smith Pottery

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.945 line:1
The cursor resizes the window. The video

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:37.957 line:1
The cursor moves the window with
train imagery to the lower right.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:41.157 line:1
In the Shifts in Composing video,
text is highlighted: Instead of a

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:44.767 line:1
straight up reading and writing style
English course, this seminar asked us

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.997 line:1
to mix mediums and to compose
without words.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:54.195 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
Whoever said that "composition" was

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:57.865 line:1
limited to the realm of words on a page
failed to understand what me and my

00:02:57.865 --> 00:02:59.845 line:1
classmates were able to learn. . . .

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:17.584 line:1
The cursor moves the potting wheel
imagery to the right, then lower left.

00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:20.924 line:1
In the Shifts in Composing video,
web materials appear and scroll.

00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:23.694 line:1
In the lower right, a train moves
along a shoreline.

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:28.984 line:1
In the Shifts in Composing video,
a passage is highlighted:

00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:32.714 line:1
While the web essay assignment still
contained some semblance to traditional

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:35.684 line:1
compositionâ€”a strong written
componentâ€”this assignment seemed

00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:38.664 line:1
to come straight from the
Communications Department. . . .

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:47.916 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
I had a much more difficult time

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:51.966 line:1
choosing a topic. I could not decide what
it is I wanted to say. This I realized was

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.816 line:1
exactly like composing in the traditional
way. . . .

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.368 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
At this point in the process,

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:04.818 line:1
the mash up's relation to composing
became clearer, and my definition of

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:06.668 line:1
composition began to shift. . . .

00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:11.203 line:1
Tools compose a mountain range and
purple-orange sky in the painting program.

00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:14.933 line:1
More text is highlighted: A video mashup
was far closer to a composition than

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:18.273 line:1
I had previously imagined,
and it was infinitely more fun. . . .

00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:30.454 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
The assignment was fascinating

00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:34.014 line:1
and exciting for me. Here, I had done
something really cool. I had composed

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:35.914 line:1
without using a single word. . . .

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:41.724 line:1
A new passage is highlighted. A callout
draws circles around phrases:

00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:43.074 line:1
people noticed it more

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.834 line:1
I emailed this video to everyone

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:46.877 line:1
I showed it and people looked.

00:04:55.706 --> 00:04:58.816 line:1
A new video appears titled:
Performing in the Learning Studio.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.006 line:1
The cursor moves and scales up the video.

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:03.387 line:1
The video shows pages in a web browser.

00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:07.327
A passage is highlighted: This class was
by far the most interesting and rewarding

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:11.317
English class I have experienced at UNC.
Professor Anderson introduced a whole new

00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:14.687
style of teaching and learning, which
proved to be much more of a class

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:17.587
conversation, and a process,
than any of my previous classes.

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:32.322
More materials show in the browser.
A passage is highlighted:

00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:35.562
This project primarily taught me the
importance of self-examination

00:05:35.562 --> 00:05:38.952
in the writing process. If I had been able
to step away from the essay

00:05:38.952 --> 00:05:42.592
when first writing it, I would have seen
that my thesis attempted to connect

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.442
too many ideas. Now I can see
the shortcomings of the essay,

00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:48.452
but in all honesty, I still am
not fully able to get past them.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.780
The cursor brings forward the "River
under African Trance" performance, showing

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.280
A guitar player colored
by red and blue lighting.

00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:58.603
In the lower right, a steam engine
rolls by.

00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:00.843
Clay spins on a potting wheel
in the lower left.

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.873
In the upper right, the painting program
shows a mountain scene.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:11.477
A video appears titled: Open Assignments,
Affective Modes, and Creativity

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:14.767
The cursor scales up the video.
The video shows pages in a browser.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.337
A passage is highlighted:
The fact our class would be

00:06:17.337 --> 00:06:21.056
centered on technology-based projects was
extremely appealing. I am a tactile,

00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:23.476
product-driven learner; I love to
manipulate ideas

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:24.996
with my hands and eyes. . . .

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:41.093
The cursor scrolls through pages
in the browser.

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:44.373
A passage is highlighted: I had to
switch gears from words and images

00:06:44.373 --> 00:06:47.813
to a more auditory and emotional mode
in completing our next assignment.

00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:51.053
A callout underlines a passage:
The thinking was the real challenge.

00:06:53.992 --> 00:06:56.506
Typing appears on screen:
I shared my work with my

00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:59.336
friends and family in a way I'd never
shared my essays.

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:03.600
On, screen the band performs in the upper
left.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.900
Clay spins on a potting wheel
in the lower left.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.210
The painting program appears
in the upper right.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.300
In the Open Assignments, Affective Modes,
and Creativity video, text is highlighted:

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.940
Once Professor Anderson explained
that it could be more about a feeling,

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.920
and less like an essay, I was good to go.
I really liked the idea of finding a way

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.830
to engage with some of my
tangled feelings about the book.

00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:33.904
On screen, videos with browsers are placed
side-by-side. A passage is highlighted:

00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:37.544
I got really in to the process of video
editing. It was very time consuming,

00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:39.077
but I also found it rewarding.

00:07:39.077 --> 00:07:42.594
It reminded me of the labor intensive
processes from some of my studio art

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.934
classes, like developing photographs
or working with a printing press.

00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:49.428 line:1
I loved the way I could manipulate the
clips and say whatever I wanted.

00:07:51.028 --> 00:07:54.728 line:1
A new passage is highlighted: Dear Reader,
This note to you is the last piece

00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:58.718 line:1
of writing I will ever do as an
undergraduate. Wow. Maybe I should

00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:02.118 line:1
say the last composition, actually,
since it's more than writing. . . .

00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:09.226 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
English majors are well accustomed

00:08:09.226 --> 00:08:12.676 line:1
to writing analytical papers on class
readings. But our projects strayed

00:08:12.676 --> 00:08:15.556 line:1
from this standard format in exciting
and intimidating ways.

00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:18.666 line:1
This class was intriguingly
self-reflective, ultimately an ongoing

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:22.486 line:1
conversation about communication and how
to better learn in a classroom setting.

00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:27.003 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
It turns out that "Performing Literature"

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:30.723 line:1
is unlike any class I've taken before. We
looked at the idea of communication

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:34.483 line:1
as something much broader than writing
alone, and at the role technology plays

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:35.783 line:1
in the way we communicate.

00:08:41.278 --> 00:08:44.488 line:1
Text is copied from a browser and pasted
into a text editor.

00:08:44.488 --> 00:08:48.478 line:1
The font is scaled up, and the video zooms
in on the passage: I got into "the zone"

00:08:48.478 --> 00:08:52.118 line:1
as I do when working on my paintings or
other art for my Studio Art classes,

00:08:52.118 --> 00:08:55.508 line:1
and I didn't even notice I'd been sitting
there for hours making it!

00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:58.918
I think this medium is much more
comparable to creating an art piece

00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:02.488
or composing music in that there are
few limitations or restrictions. . . .

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:10.885
A new passage is highlighted:
I also managed to find a clip that made

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:14.115
the loud banging sound about halfway
through the trailer make sense.

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:20.106
On screen, videos play: a potting wheel,
trains, painting, pages in browsers.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.160
A passage is highlighted:
I ran into massive technical difficulties.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.020
So my screencast became about the messy
process of making itself. I actually had

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.500
a lot of fun with it. It was pretty
freeing to just give up some control,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.220
and adapt to what was happening.

00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:40.505
The painting program is moved to the left
showing a landscape with mountains.

00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:48.495
The cursor rearranges videos.
A passage is highlighted:

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:52.135
Doing the Prezi and group presentation
really helped us to focus our idea,

00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:55.625
and to figure out what needed work
in our analysis. Our presentation

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.295
had a much more meaningful analysis
than our first draft.

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.121
The cursor rearranges videos on screen.

00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:12.985
A passage is highlighted:
This course has also placed

00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:16.285
a strong emphasis on revision. As an
English major, I'm accustomed to

00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:20.325
the long process of editing. But Professor
Anderson has taken revising a step further

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:24.265
in this course. As the Fall semester draws
to a close, I have not received a single

00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:26.055
grade on any of these projects. . . .

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:37.855
A new passage is highlighted:
Yet, in most college classes, the

00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:41.035
writing relationship is constant
â€”one to one, student to professor.

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:44.762
Writing takes place in the private space 
of one's computer or notebook. . . .

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:51.485 line:1
A new passage is highlighted:
I was very relieved that I could

00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:55.425 line:1
do an abstract reading for the screencast 
though, because I feel like viewers can

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:58.925 line:1
get more out of the atmosphere created by
the screencast instead of having

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.145 line:1
the information pounded
into their heads. . . .

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:08.459 line:1
The cursor rearranges videos on screen.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.796 line:1
In the upper right,
a passenger train rolls by.

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.186 line:1
In the lower left, a vase spins
on a potting wheel.

00:11:15.327 --> 00:11:18.567 line:1
The cursor moves two videos showing pages
in browsers side by side.

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:21.457 line:1
In both videos, phrases
and snippets of text are highlighted:

00:11:21.457 --> 00:11:23.637 line:1
I wanted to bring to life
this emotional poem;

00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:24.487 line:1
And a voice;

00:11:24.487 --> 00:11:25.237 line:1
video;

00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:26.197 line:1
and audio;

00:11:26.197 --> 00:11:27.597 line:1
instructing him to speak;

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:29.697 line:1
the things the speaker was feeling;

00:11:29.697 --> 00:11:31.437 line:1
an audio recording of rolling waves;

00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:33.147 line:1
to augment the feeling of great;

00:11:33.147 --> 00:11:34.437 line:1
spacious loneliness.

00:11:41.202 --> 00:11:44.152 line:1
A passage is highlighted:
The works I have created have taken

00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:47.382 line:1
time and attention, but they also required
a great deal of help.

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.395 line:1
The video with the band performing ends.

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:58.001 line:1
The cursor moves materials off screen.

00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:07.486 line:1
All windows are minimized leaving
a white screen.
