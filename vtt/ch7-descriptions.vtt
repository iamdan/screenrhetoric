00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:51.453
utters can be approached
only in terms of paradox.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.659

[The poet must] work by analogies,
metaphors do not lie in the same plane

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:17.574
or fit neatly edge to edge. There is a
continual tilting of the planes;

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.204
necessary overlappings, discrepancies,
contradictions.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:26.975

a single word: contradictions.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:34.325

attributes are ascribed. The vehicle

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:57.132
is the subject whose attributes are
borrowed. . . .

a link to the wikipedia page.

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:09.035

and a title: Get a Mac. The cursor clicks

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:16.005
a thumbnail. A video fills the screen.
Two figures appear against a white

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:19.855
background. On the left is a man in a
trench coat. On the right is a man in a

00:03:19.855 --> 00:03:23.495

is not made of nylon thread, words or any

00:03:57.772 --> 00:04:01.691
durable substance but is the trace left
behind by some moving agent. It has to be

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.251
traced anew by the passage of another
vehicle, another circulating entity.

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:09.158
The image zooms in to show the page with
pencil marks around words:

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:09.918
vehicle

Wow . . . texture,

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:26.165

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:49.876
wheelchair with casts on

book fills the editor. The image zooms in
and a passage is highlighted:

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.099
They, too, depend on a flood of entities
to exist. To be an 'actor' is now at last

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.428
a fully artificial and fully traceable
gathering.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.590

yellow.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:41.827
The cursor turns down the opacity on the
yellow paint, revealing the passage:

00:08:41.827 --> 00:08:45.657
Writing describes a subset of rhetoric:
those productions whose mode of

00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:47.547
delivery is written language. . . .

00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:54.892
The screen fills with a new image editor
window. A scanned page fills the editor.

00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:58.742
A passage is highlighted: the circulation
of quasi-standards allow[s] anonymous

00:08:58.742 --> 00:09:02.272
and isolated agencies to slowly become,
layer after layer, comparable and

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:06.212
commensurable--which is surely a large
part of what we mean by being human. . . .

00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:13.602
The image zooms in on the passage: freedom
is getting out of a bad bondage

00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:15.062
not an absence of bonds.
