00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.070
(Male narrator) Welcome. This project 
reflects on a course

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.590
that focused on digital composing 
and performance.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:08.934
[camera snapshot]

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.029
You'll find here a collection of materials
composed during and after the course.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.023
The project includes the creative work 
of many people.

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:21.626
It serves as a kind of portfolio 
for an entire class.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.470
We're calling it 
"Casting Learning into Flowing Streams,"

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:30.964
or, "This is what we did in our class."

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:36.298
These screencasts capture performances 
as they record activities

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.078
and they include overviews
and discussions of performance,

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:44.025
portfolios, composing, and creativity.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.334
These pieces at the top provide 
the insights of the authors

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:51.566
about some of the projects 
created in the course.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:55.402
The videos reflect on student work.

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:58.692
It's possible to move from 
left to right among these,

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.552
though certainly not necessary.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:05.415
The videos below include pieces 
referred to in the discussions above.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:11.291
Screencasts by Austin Cooper, 
Sarah Brady, Sean Mattio, Katie Meyer,

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:18.086
Jackclyn Ngo, Austin Shaw, Sydney Stegall,
Hannah Easley, and Kelly Wollman

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:23.526
are of two types: sample projects 
that represent digital composing

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:28.231
and reflective videos 
created for course portfolios.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.268
The next segment of this video 
provides an overview

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:35.368
of the teaching philosophies 
associated with the course.

00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:40.486
It was recorded as a live performance, 
with this voiceover added now.

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.113
I've opened a browser window 
with a video by Ronnie Tucker,

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:47.033
capturing some digital painting.

00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:51.575
And I want a soundtrack 
for the performance.

00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:54.974
This is String Cheese Incident doing
"River Under African Trance."

00:01:55.128 --> 00:01:56.608
[crowd sounds, music playing]

00:01:56.797 --> 00:02:00.797
I'm going to transform these bits to bring
into view a teaching philosophy.

00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:05.038
It's linked with digital composing, 
creativity,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:07.689
and a studio model of the classroom.

00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:08.874
[live music plays]

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.099
This is some pottery making 
by Charles Smith.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.904
I'm bringing in some archive footage. 
It's called "Big Trains Rolling."

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.427
[music plays, strings, keyboards, drums]

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.715
And this is one of my videos. It looks at
student reflections

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.617
on projects created
for the undergraduate class.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.058
When you finish with 
all of these materials,

00:02:32.058 --> 00:02:36.378
you may wonder about the course title, 
“Introduction to Literary Studies.”

00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:41.862
Both lower and upper division students, 
many English majors, made up the group.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:45.688
The class is mostly 
about digital composing.

00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:49.540
[live music plays]

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.270 line:1
Austin points out the way 
the class treats words

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.304 line:1
as one among many composing materials.

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:00.984 line:1
He reflects on a shared sense 
of accomplishment, and on digital projects

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.560 line:1
leading to a holistic understanding of
what it means to compose.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.676
[live music; strings, drums]

00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:10.632
The class assignments call for 
shifts among modes.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.710
Opening the channels of sound and image, 
word and motion,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.860
allows new stories to be heard.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:22.133
And moving among these materials 
creates rhetorical fluencies,

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:27.982 line:1
spillovers, strategies, 
techniques, and questions.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:31.608 line:1
Austin asks, "shouldn't an English class
teach us

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.548 line:1
how to utilize words more effectively?

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:38.208 line:1
What can a video mashup
teach me about composition?"

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.488
[live music; bass guitar, drums, strings]

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.079
He discovers that mashups reveal 
familiar facets of composing.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:52.171 line:1
We find brainstorming, focusing, authors, 
purposes—"What [do] I [want] to say?"

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.143
So old currents blend with 
new through digital projects.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:01.242 line:1
The teaching philosophy 
pushes this blending.

00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:06.774 line:1
We practice with tools, play with genres, 
extend words with images or music,

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:08.208 line:1
[strings, drums]

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:11.953 line:1
and discover a fluid sense 
of materials and messages.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.150 line:1
And shifting modes does more.

00:04:15.808 --> 00:04:20.018 line:1
It mixes up the educational elixir
of motivation and engagement.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.629
[music plays: bass guitar and drums
with strings and keyboards]

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:31.467
We know that writing with its risks and 
publics can bring a sense of authenticity.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.409
And authenticity is linked 
with engagement.

00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:38.918
And both are amplified 
through social space.

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:43.902 line:1
When shifting modes, projects aren't 
crafted for some imagined reader.

00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:48.363 line:1
They are cast out into the world.

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.997
[live music plays]

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.329
I'm going to bring another 
video into this piece.

00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.371
This one looks at performances 
and processes,

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:02.592
and some of the portfolio elements 
of the course.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.881
And let me interrupt the flow here 
to prepare you for a skip

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:07.751
[music stops; brief silence]

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.631
A small gap in the song.

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:13.952
In her portfolio, Michela reflects on the 
way the class was configured

00:05:13.952 --> 00:05:18.225
as a conversation, an image speaking
to the organic nature of composing

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.799
and the emergent qualities
of projects in the course.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.690
The conversation is captured 
in part through portfolios.

00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:30.074
[music plays; light picking of mandolin,
strings, keyboards]

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.239
Here, Sydney reflects 
on composing a web essay.

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:37.912
The portfolio captures processes 
and learning that comes from

00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:41.282
happenstance or 
less-than-perfect projects.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.942
The web essay raised 
particular challenges with

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:47.532
its one foot firmly planted 
in written essay mode,

00:05:48.044 --> 00:05:52.044
and the other pushing students
to compose with media.

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:55.595
Video, image, and sound meet words—

00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.825
but in their native space 
of the composing window.

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:03.244
[live music plays]

00:06:03.623 --> 00:06:05.807
Let me bring in my third video.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:08.277
This one touches on affect and creativity.

00:06:09.644 --> 00:06:12.383
One of the claims we are making
is that digital composing

00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:15.073
opens new channels for sharing stories.

00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:18.545
These channels bring new voices 
into scholarly conversations.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.830 line:1
Jackclyn reports on her 
tactile approach to ideas.

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:27.491 line:1
Modes of composing both 
enable and limit participation.

00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:31.447 line:1
Broadening the available means makes 
possible the creation and sharing

00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:34.960 line:1
of knowledge by those who 
otherwise might be filtered out.

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:36.134
[drums, strings]

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.599
Channels open when shifting modes.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.717
When students moved from web
essays to mashups, they switched gears,

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:47.369
discovering what Jackclyn calls 
a more auditory and emotional mode.

00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:51.753
Jackclyn moves through these 
channels to create knowledge.

00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:56.819
Her reflection speaks to her 
engagement with texts, with ideas,

00:06:56.986 --> 00:07:02.046 line:1
with cultural connections, and her 
willingness to share this engagement.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.305
[live music]

00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:08.666
These shifts in affordances 
beg for revisions in teaching.

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:13.307
Hannah notes the ability to 
move forward once given license

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:17.969
to make her screencast more about 
a feeling and less like an essay.

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.441
We find new channels for 
connecting and affective modes

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:27.422
of communicating, allowing Hannah
to engage with her tangled feelings.

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.119
Classrooms become studio-like 
environments, productive spaces,

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:37.529
where students manipulate materials

00:07:37.818 --> 00:07:39.435
[drums, strings, keyboards]

00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:41.371
and have their say.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.669
[live music plays]

00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:50.307
Reflecting and speaking 
generates rhetorical knowledge.

00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:55.301
Dear reader, Hannah says, this note 
to you is the last piece of writing

00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:58.411
I will ever do as an undergraduate. Wow.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:04.276
Maybe I should say the last composition, 
actually, since it's more than writing.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.590
[live music]

00:08:06.824 --> 00:08:10.144
Michela notes how projects 
strayed from expectations.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.600
Here, we begin to recognize 
signs of creativity.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:17.638 line:1
Where we see gratification and pride 
mixed with frustration,

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.129 line:1
we find assignments that 
move beyond boredom.

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:24.332
The projects introduce 
unfamiliarity and challenges.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.870
There is a heightened sense of working 
with technologies and materials,

00:08:29.234 --> 00:08:31.024
of rhetorical resistance.

00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:36.162
But the challenges and activities emerge
in a collaborative, productive space

00:08:37.422 --> 00:08:41.422
and through the ongoing 
composing supported by portfolios.

00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:47.883
[music continues playing; sparse keyboard
notes, steady strings, bass and drums]

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:52.819
The result is the kind of balance 
between frustration and accomplishment

00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:58.802
often associated with creative 
endeavors—the mythical flow state.

00:09:00.037 --> 00:09:02.327
As Katie puts it, I got into the zone.

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:07.210
I didn't even notice I'd been 
sitting there for hours.

00:09:08.077 --> 00:09:11.437
We see this creative state 
when working with digital modes.

00:09:11.741 --> 00:09:15.071
Fixing a mismatched sound or 
struggling with a technical jam

00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:20.116
provides a kind of material pushback that
helps induce heightened engagement

00:09:20.858 --> 00:09:22.158
and sometimes frustration.

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.462
[live music]

00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:27.767
Hannah notes how this messiness became 
the focus of her composition,

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:32.916
pointing out the freedom that comes from 
adapting to what is happening.

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:38.538
[live music; steady strings,
bass guitar, drums]

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:43.448
An improvisational current flows 
through the teaching philosophy.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:48.746
Drafts, activities, and performances 
become heuristic,

00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:53.467
leading to new knowledge and furthering 
the development of projects.

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.604
[live music plays]

00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:01.221
Such ongoing composing also calls for 
new modes of reading and assessment.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:06.075
Again, portfolios fit well 
and help voices emerge.

00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:11.258
In fact, these portfolios themselves 
become digital compositions

00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:13.448
developed through shifting modes.

00:10:14.193 --> 00:10:18.409 line:1
Katie explains that she has not received a
single grade on any of her projects.

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:23.719 line:1
Instead, the portfolio itself—revised 
many times—becomes the

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:27.099 line:1
representation of her work and learning.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.139
And the philosophy redraws the boundaries 
of the classroom through a collaborative,

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:35.752
emergent, and widely public 
approach to composing.

00:10:36.738 --> 00:10:41.579 line:1
Works in progress are posted.
Readers respond. Writers revise.

00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:45.938 line:1
The openness and shared sense 
of composing transforms relationships.

00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:51.055 line:1
Public composing amplifies 
investment and authenticity.

00:10:51.687 --> 00:10:57.276 line:1
Jackclyn sees her screencast as akin to 
other class texts, calls herself a creator

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:02.476 line:1
crossing the boundary between consumer 
and producer of knowledge.

00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:03.827
[live music]

00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:08.178
Digital composing is here layered 
with authenticity and engagement,

00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:12.022
collaborative spaces, 
new channels and modes.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:13.511
[music slows]

00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:15.311
We're shifting.

00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:19.828 line:1
Austin started us off 
asking about composing.

00:11:20.778 --> 00:11:22.388 line:1
Let's watch some.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:25.295 line:1
Serendipitous, really, 
these clips flowing together.

00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:28.711 line:1
Austin and Hannah, thinking 
about feeling and voice.

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:31.946 line:1
I'm talking about 
what we did in our class.

00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:36.289 line:1
We're listening while reading pictures 
of audio rolling like waves.

00:11:36.378 --> 00:11:37.378 line:1
[sparse guitar notes]

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:40.177
Our ideas of composition 
have changed.

00:11:40.343 --> 00:11:44.343
It has taken attention, time, and help.

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:47.361
[music performance winds down, then stops]

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:50.709
The sound track has stopped,

00:11:51.233 --> 00:11:54.513
but extensions of the performance 
are beginning to build.

00:11:55.266 --> 00:11:57.886
We see them pixelated here. They echo.

00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:01.924
In motion they continue having their say.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.690
They should never stop.
