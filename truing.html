    This video was created as a model project for an undergraduate writing
    class. The assignment focused on media-oriented composing, but required
    that videos also emphasize words on screen. The piece was further developed
    and mixed into the publication <em>Watch the Bubble</em>, in 2012. It
    captures a live performance that includes manipulation of multiple videos,
    an audio player, and live typing. The version included here was recorded in
    2018.
</p>
<p>
    In many ways, processing the piece is reasonably straightforward. The
    viewer can easily take in the text that is typed on sticky notes on the
    computer screen. At the same time, some points are implicit in bicycle
    spokes, guitar strings, and processes of tuning. Additional videos offer
scientific information or visuals related to bubbles and surfaces.    <em>Truing</em> also includes three recordings of the song "Holocene" in
    video windows as well as one in an iTunes window.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>
    00:00 The video opens with web browser windows on screen: in the upper
    left, a male figure with a guitar; in the upper right, a video with a live
    performance of the song "Holocene" by Bon Iver; in the lower right, a video
    with a female figure holding a guitar; in the lower left, a video clip
    showing an old man on a beach making enormous soap bubbles using two sticks
    and some string. The cursor selects play on all of the materials. The
    cursor moves to the top of the screen and brings forward an iTunes window
    containing an audio file of the live performance of the song "Holocene" by
    Bon Iver. The cursor selects play, and then a visualizer is turned on,
    transforming the iTunes window into a computer-generated image of horizons,
    planets, and suns. The band eases into the song. From the video with large
    bubbles on a beach in the lower left, a narration track begins: "I hate to
    even write or think about alt-scholarship. I've thought for some time that
    you don't write about the digital; you do digital work."
</p>
<p>
    00:25 The male and female figures with guitars begin speaking, offering
    instruction on how to play the song: "uh, I'm going to try and explain how
    to play Bon Iver's . . ." ; "Hello, YouTube! Um . . ." The cursor moves to
    the video in the lower left and mutes the volume on the narrative track.
    The vocals in the live performance of the song begin. The cursor moves to
    the right of the screen and brings forward a sticky note window and begins
    to type: "We're here to make an idea real, a movie. It will be a moving
    thing that brings response. The bicycle. The bee sting. Guitar string."
</p>
<p>
    01:21 The cursor brings forward a video clip in the lower left of the
    screen and selects play. An image of a spinning bicycle wheel in a truing
    frame appears. The cursor moves back to the sticky note and continues
    typing: "The shearsman strumming into being the bread and the stone, which
    links us to craft, which leads us to art, which brings us to now."
</p>
<p>
    02:02 The cursor minimizes the sticky note and then brings a new sticky
    note on screen and continues typing: "We need words like water. We need
    their circulations for turning ideas, for truing them, for bringing them
    into tune, the way a wheel might speak through its spokes."
</p>
<p>
    02:48 In the bottom left, the video of the man blowing large bubbles is
    replaced by the video of the spinning bicycle wheel, which shows hands
    truing the wheel. For a moment, the sticky note and its words are obscured,
    then it returns to the foreground and the typing continues: "Thus, we, too,
    give voice through the wires."
</p>
<p>
    03:05 The cursor brings the video of the man making giant bubbles forward;
    the turning bicycle wheel is no longer visible. The video with giant
    bubbles begins to show additional layers with shorelines and a boy
    beachcombing. The typing in the sticky note continues: "We're drifting like
    sand or sea shifting over plates, like wetlines changing place with the
    tides. We're lifting. Collecting. Spacing. Repeating. Gathering before
    coming ashore."
</p>
<p>
    03:42 The live performance of the song concludes its second verse and moves
    into a soft instrumental segment. The cursor minimizes the second sticky
    note and moves it off the screen. The male and female figures demonstrate
    how to play the song; the woman's voice is audible: "and then you're gonna
    do the third fret, fifth string." The male voice can be heard: "You don't
    always have to do this sort of intricate pull off, hammer on with the song.
    . . ." The live performance of the song in the upper right is stopped. The
    cursor brings forward the iTunes window and selects stop; without the
    music, both guitar instructors' voices are more audible, but their words
    overlap. The cursor turns up the volume on the video with the old man
    making bubbles and a brief snippet of the narration is heard: "We need
    scholarship that looks at art and knowledge."
</p>
<p>
    04:08 As the videos of guitar instruction and of a man truing a bicycle
    wheel continue to play, the cursor brings a video describing the science of
    bubbles to the foreground and selects play. The narrator in the science of
    bubbles video speaks: "There is a method to the bubble madness that unlocks
    some pretty basic laws of nature. Law number one, they act like a prism,
    reflecting the basic colors of the universe." The woman teaching the Bon
    Iver song begins singing softly in the background. An interview voice in
    the science of bubbles video speaks: "White light coming in is actually
    composed of all the colors in the rainbow and based on the thickness of the
    film, all the different colors refract off in different ways. So, just like
    a prism, we get the whole spectrum in every bubble. The amazing thing to me
    is that when you look up close it looks like bubbles are clear, but there
    is so much color going on." A second interview voice responds: "That is
    correct. It's every color of the rainbow. I like to think that the colors
    are a map, showing you that the film is thick in some places and thinner in
    others." The science of bubbles video is muted. The voices of the male
    figure, the narration in the bubble video, and the woman singing blend
    together.
</p>
<p>
    05:08. The cursor rearranges videos on screen, and then selects play on the
    live performance of the song. The music—still soft—continues. The cursor
    brings forward the iTunes window and selects play on the live performance
    of the song. The song is now layered, echoing due to the timing being
    slightly off on the two performances. After a few seconds, the cursor turns
    down the sound on the iTunes window and moves the window off the screen.
</p>
<p>
    05:45 The cursor brings a new sticky note to the screen and begins to type:
    "Light casts movements like blue or green or blue and green. The tracings
    are breath or wind or liquid flowings. . . ." The cursor brings forward the
    science of bubbles video to reveal a hand pushing through the film of a
    bubble. The transparency of the sticky note is increased so that the text
    is opaque over the image of the hand and bubble. The cursor types: "like
    skin turning bubble and returning wet with mind sight. The mixing laps at
    the overlaps of image, song, word, or heard whisper from a front porch.
    Shh. . . . This is important."
</p>
<p>
    06:54 The live performance of the song concludes, and the cursor presses
    stop on the video in the upper right. The audio from the guitar instructors
    is audible; both the man and woman sing different parts of the song. The
    video with bubbles is moved to the upper right corner of the screen; it now
    also shows opaque layers with bees and flowers.
</p>
<p>
    07:12 The cursor turns up the sound on the science of bubbles video, brings
    forward another sticky note, and then pastes in the phrase, "Shh. . . .
    This is important." The cursor begins to type: "It's the healing of the
    split. It's the organic mechanic opening a window to say, we can change
    shape." In the science of bubbles video, the two interview voices converse:
    "So there it is. It's pretty amazing. You think of it as one event, instant
    event, but there you really see the tear. You never think of it as a
    directional event. It just looks like it's there and it's gone." The
    science of bubbles video shows a ball bearing thrown through a soap bubble
    in slow motion, the ball tearing the edge, and then bursting the bubble.
    The narrator of the video speaks: "Watch the bubble burst again, even
    slower this time." The male guitar player sings in vague falsetto.
</p>
<p>
    07:35 The narrator of the science of bubbles video continues: "There's some
    complex science going on here. Surface tension holds the soap bubble
    molecules together while the air inside the bubble forces them apart. When
    the bubble begins to tear, soap molecules shoot out in all directions as
    tiny droplets." The cursor continues to type in the sticky note: "we can
    move together as we do in this moment through the film." The cursor moves
    the sticky note off the screen. The cursor mutes the science of bubbles
    video. A new video appears on screen showing bubbles floating through the
    air.
</p>
<p>
    08:02 The cursor brings a video on screen containing a male figure in front
    of a bicycle wheel on a workbench. The cursor selects play and the figure
    begins plucking the spokes and speaking: "After radially truing the rim,
    pluck a number of spokes on the drive side and listen for the tone." The
    ringing of the spokes is barely audible over the speaking of the guitar
    instructors. In the upper left, the male guitarist plucks strings near the
    tuning pegs of his guitar and says, "after the second time he sings the
    chorus, I just pluck these little top bits." The plucking of the strings is
    barely heard. In the upper right, the man with the wheel at the workbench
    continues: "Then pluck a number of spokes on the non-drive side and also
    listen for the tone." The cursor lowers the sound of the video.
</p>
<p>
    08:35 The male guitarist can be heard: "after the third verse, the
    Christmas-y verse, you want to slow down a bit and just play long, languid
    notes and try to think of the suitable timing to hit the next bit of the
    line." The video is muted. In the video in the lower left with the spinning
    bicycle wheel, a male figure can be heard: "When I squeeze these spokes,
    there's really good resistance. And that's how you want it to be. It's nice
    and tight all around." The man sweeps his fingers over the spokes in the
    bicycle wheel and continues: "So, technically, they should all have about
    the same tightness." The cursor mutes that video. The cursor slowly mutes
    the video of the woman playing and singing the Bon Iver song. The video
    ends.

  <p>
    The video features four variations of live performances of the song
    "Holocene." One, performed by Bon Iver on July 29, 2011, has been selected
from concert videos posted on YouTube. This video is played live in    <em>Truing</em>, and a copy of this recording is played using an iTunes
    audio player. Two additional versions of the song are included in the
    piece. Both of these have been gathered from how-to-play videos hosted on
    YouTube.
</p>
<p>
    A number of other videos provide visual and sonic materials. These include
    videos with instruction on bicycle wheel truing as well as a video on the
    science of bubbles and a video depicting bubbles. <em>Truing</em> also
    includes a compilation video that brings together imagery of bees and
    flowers, waves and shorelines, and figures creating large bubbles. These
    materials have been sampled from numerous items hosted online. The
    compilation video includes a narrative track that sheds light on the themes
    in the piece; however, the volume of this narration is turned down for most
    of the live performance of <em>Truing</em>, keeping the insights hidden.

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The fundamental tone, and its overtones, have, each of them, their own
    intensities. This pattern of intensities can be analysed into the relative
    intensities of the various tones and the absolute intensity which is the
    total loudness. The scale of relative intensities enters into the final
    quality of the note, with some independence of its absolute loudness. <span class="attribution">Alfred North Whitehead, <span class="attribution-title">Process and
Reality</span> (234)</span> </aside>



<p>
    "Bon Iver's Holocene" has an atmospheric quality. Blending effects, airy
    vocals, and repeated guitar patterns, the sound is layered and open-ended.
    The primary soundtrack is provided by a video of a live performance of the
    song. For resonance, a second instance of the performance is
    played in an iTunes window. The second iteration calls for tuning, since
    the timing is slightly off and the volume needs to be lowered to create a
    sense of echoing. Similar adjustments must be made to the how-to
    performances and other media elements. Of such sonic materials, Alfred
    North Whitehead says that "relative intensities" must be weighed as we
    consider the feelings associated with even a single note. This weighing of
    intensities is an apt model for screen composing. Meaning emerges as
    elements accrue overtones and merge into harmonies.
</p>
<p>
    Such composing invites "analysis [that] reveals an abstract qualitative
    pattern which is the complex relatedness of the fundamental tone-quality
    with the tone-qualities of its select overtones" (234). The audio elements
    in the piece bring this coemergent, intensity-based, layered experience to
    scholarship. The overtones are amplified by the additive compositional
    method, combining more and more visual and sonic materials. The two
    versions of the Bon Iver performance resonate with each other through
    adjustments in volume and timing. They similarly relate to the how-to
    videos. The how-to relationship, at the same time, is more adjacent,
    introducing distance and dissonance as well as similarity and resonance.
    The composing brings the similarities and differences together through
    tunings of intensities.

<aside class="pullquote-left">A speculative pragmatism takes as its starting point a rigor of
    experimentation. It is interested in the anarchy at the heart of all
    process, and is engaged with the techniques that tune the anarchical toward
    new modes of knowledge and new modes of experience. It is also committed to
    what escapes the order, and interested in what this excess can do. It
    implicitly recognizes that knowledge is invented in the escape, in the
    excess. <span class="attribution">Erin Manning, <span class="attribution-title">The Minor Gesture</span> (38)</span></aside>
  </p>

<p>
    <em>Truing</em>
    foregrounds written text in its composition. "We need words like water,"
    the video claims, "for turning ideas. For truing them." All symbolic
    meaning, Susan Langer tells us, creates movements of abstraction and
    understanding, but words have a particular power. Invested with both visual
    and sonic relations, a "word-picture" (73) or "sound-unit . . . becomes a
    symbol to us, for some item in the world" (72). Unlike sounds or images
    themselves, words bring added apprehension through causal connections and
    relationships. "The trick of naming relations instead of illustrating them
    gives language a tremendous scope; one word can thus take care of a
    situation that would require a whole sheet of drawings to depict" (74).
    Langer says that "the greatest virtue of verbal symbols is, probably, their
    tremendous readiness to enter into <em>combinations</em>" (76). Words drive
    us toward sequences that reveal "the correlation of symbols with concepts
    and concepts with things" (77). In <em>Truing</em>, the typing that plays
    out on sticky notes affirms the power of these linguistic combinations.
</p>
<p>
    The verbal patterns and resonances combine with visual and sonic
    sequencing. Heavy repetition has refined the timing of where to queue the
    playhead, when to select play on a video clip, and how to arrange the
    materials in the live performance. In these interactions, the sense of
    tuning is experienced by the human performer working with (and against)
    compositional materials (that include words). This work, as Andrew
    Pickering reminds us, links these material interactions with invention: "Such practice consists in the reciprocal tuning of human
    and material agency, tuning that can itself reconfigure human intentions"
    (21). Material shapings make it so screen-performed texts are never the
    same. Subtle adjustments emerge through "a goal-oriented practice [that]
    takes the form of a dance of agency" (21).
</p>
<p>
    These material and sonic tunings play out in a situational context.
    Whitehead notes that feelings linked to sonic materials are extended by the
    "complex ordered environment composed of certain other actual entities
    which, however vaguely, is felt by reason of this audition. This
    environment is the datum of this feeling. It is the external world, as
    grasped systematically in this feeling" (324). <em>Truing</em> captures
    composing as coemergent creation in a setting that conditions our
    experience of symbolic materials. At 08:05, a how-to video showing bicycle
    rim truing is played: "Pluck a number of spokes on the drive side, and
    listen for the tone," the video narrator instructs. At the same time, in a
    how-to video, the player plucks strings between the bridge and the tuning
    pegs of a guitar: "I just pluck these little top bits." The entities come
    together as the audiovisual associations (strings and spokes) are tuned and
    cast through the layered spaces of the screen.
