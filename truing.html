<p>This video was created as a model for an assignment in an undergraduate writing class. The class focused on media-oriented writing, but included a "word film" assignment, which required that videos include significant elements of written language. The video is a screen recording of a live performance that includes manipulating several media items on screen and typing text on screen.
</p>
<p>00:00 The video opens with windows on screen. In the upper-left, appears a video on YouTube with a male figure with a guitar. In the upper-right, appears a video on YouTube with a live performance of the song, "Holocene," by Bon Iver. In the lower-right a video on YouTube with a female figure holding a guitar appears. In the lower-left, we see a video clip showing an old man on the beach blowing enourmous bubbles using two sticks and some string. The cursor selects play on all of the materials. The cursor moves to the top of the screen and brings forward an iTunes window containing an audio file of the live performance of the song, "Holocene," by Bon Iver. The cursor select play, and then a visualizer is turned on, translating the iTunes window into a computer-generated image of horizons,  planets, and suns.
</p>
<p>00:25. The figures in the the YouTube videos begin speaking, offering instruction on how to play the song. The live performance of the song plays. The cursor moves to the right of the screen and brings forward a sticky note window and begins to type:
</p>
<p>We’re here to make an idea real,
<br />  a movie.
<br />It will be a moving thing
<br />that brings response.
<br />The bee sting.
<br />The bicycle.
<br />Guitar string.
</p>
<p>01:17 The cursor moves to the bottom of the screen and brings forward a video clip in the lower-left of the screen and selects play. An image of a spinning bicycle wheel appears. The cursor moves back to the sticky note and continues typing:

<p>The shearsman
<br />strumming into being
<br />the bread and the stone,
<br />which links to craft,
<br />which leads to art,
<br />which brings us to now.

<p>02:02 The cursor minimizes the sticky note, moves it off screen, and then brings a new sticky note on screen and continues typing:

<p>We nee[d] words like water.
<br />We need their circulations
<br />for turning ideas,
<br />for truing them
<br />and bringing them into tune,
<br />the way a wheel might speak
<br />through its spokes.
<br />Thus,
<br />we,
<br />too,
<br />give voice
<br />through the wire.

<p>We’re shifting like sand and sea
<br />drifting over plates,
<br />like wetlines
<br />changing place
<br />with the tides.
<br />We’re lifting.
<br />Collecting.
<br />Spacing.
<br />And repeating.
<br />Gathering
<br />before coming ashore.

<p>03:42 The live performance of the song concludes its second verse and moves into a soft instrumental segment. The cursor minimizes the second sticky note and moves it off the screen. The cursor switches the positions of the videos with male and female figures demonstrating how to play the song. The cursor then selects stop on the live performance of the song. The cursor then brings forward the iTunes window and selects stop.

<p>04:08 The cursor brings a video on screen and selects play. The video contains images showing the properties of bubbles. The narrator in the video speaks: There is a method to the bubble madness that unlocks some pretty basic laws of nature. Law number one, they act like a prism reflecting the basic colors of the universe. An interview voice in the video speaks: white light coming in is actually composed of all the colers in the rainbow and based on the thickness of the film, all the differenct colors refract off in a different ways so just like a prism we get the whole spectrum in every bubble. The amazing thing to me is that when you look up close, it looks like bubbles are clear but there is so much color going on. A second interview voice responds: That is correct, it's every color of the rainbow. I like to think that the colors are a map, showing you that the film is thick in some places and thinner in others.

<p>O5:03. The cursor turns down the sound on the video showing bubble properties. The cursor rearranges videos on screen and then selects play on the live perfromance of the song. The music—still soft—continues. The cursor brings forward the iTunes window and selects play on the live performance of the song. The song can be heard layers and echoing as the timing is now slightly off on the two performances. After a few seconds, the cursor turns down the sound on the iTunes window and moves the window off the screen.

<p>05:34 The cursor brings a new sticky note to the screen and begins to type:

<p>Light casts movements
<br />like green or blue
<br />or green and blue.
<br />The tracings are
<br />breath or wind
<br />or flowings
<br />like skin turning bubble
<br />and returning wet
<br />with mind sight.
<br />The mixing laps at the overlaps
<br />of image, song, word,
<br />or heard whisper from a front porch.
<br />Shh. . . .
<br />This is important.

<p>06:44 The live performance of the song concludes, and the cursor presses stop on the video in the upper right. The cursor moves the video with bubbles and bees to the upper-right corner of the screen. The cursor turns up the sound on the video showing bubble properties.  The cursor brings forward another sticky note and begins to type:

<p>This is the healing of the split.
<br />It’s the organic mechanic
<br />opening a window to see
<br />surfaces, saying
<br />we can change shape,
<br />we can move together
<br />as we do in this moment
<br />through the film.

<p>In the video showing bubble properties, the two and interview voices converse: So there it is. It's pretty amazing. You think of it as one event, instant event, but there you really see the tear. You never think of it as a directional event. It just looks like it's there and it's gone. The narrator of the video speaks: Watch the bubble burst again, even slower this time. There's some complex science going on here. Surface tension holds the soap bubble molecules together while the air inside the bubble forces them apart. When the bubble begins to tear, soap molecules shoot out in all directions as tiny droplets.

<p>08:05 The cursor brings a video on screen containing a male figure in front of a bicycle wheel on a workbench. The cursor selects play and the figure begins plucking the spokes and speaking: After radially truing the rim, pluck a number of spokes on the drive side and listen for the tone. Then pluck a number of spokes on the non-drive side and also listen for the tone. The cursor fades the sound of the videos on screen out. The video ends.

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The fundamental tone, and its overtones, have, each of them, their own
intensities. This pattern of intensities can be analysed into the relative
intensities of the various tones and the absolute intensity which is the
total loudness. The scale of relative intensities enters into the final quality
of the note, with some independence of its absolute loudness. -- Process and Reality 234
</aside>


<p>This video emerged, as is typical, from a number of converging impulses and
activities. While exploring media-based composing in my teaching, Iwrapping up
the publication of "Watch the Bubble," I prompted students to create "word
films" to experiment with integrating textual and verbal elements into visual
compositions. I also was working to expand a repetoire for delivering academic
presentations by conducting live performances with materials on screen. And I
was wrapping up the publication of the piece, "Watch the Bubble" and thinking
about the ways the science of bubbles might represent aspects of emergent
composing. These movements came together in the captured performance.</p>

<p>While a number of video clips are arranged and moved during the performance,
a core concern related to the media composing is the mixing of sound. The
primary soundtrack is provided by the live performance of the song, "Holocene,"
by Bon Iver. To create a sense of echoing, a second iteration of the song is
woven into the mix. The second iteration instantly creates an opportunity for
tuning as the volume must be adjusted. Similar adjustments must be made to the
volume levels of the "how-to" performances and other media elements. Whitehead
notes that "relative intensitities" must be weighed as we consider the feelings
associated with even a single note. This weighing of intensities is an apt model
for screen composing, as elements accrue overtones and merge into patterns.<p>

  <p>Such composing calls for "analysis [that] reveals an abstract qualitative
  pattern which is the complex relatedness of the fundamental tone-quality with
  the tone-qualities of its select overtones" (234). The audio elements in the
  piece call for this kind of intensity-based, experiential reading. The call is
  amplified by the additive nature of compositional method, combining more and
  more layers and sonic materials as the performance plays out. The two versions
  of the Bon Iver performance relate with each other through a kind of
  resonance. They similarly relate to the "how to" performances through a kind
  of adjaceney. The composing brings the similarities and differnces together through tuning<p>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> A speculative pragmatism takes as its starting point a rigor of experimentation.
It is interested in the anarchy at the heart of all process, and is
engaged with the techniques that tune the anarchical toward new modes
of knowledge and new modes of experience. It is also committed to what
escapes the order, and interested in what this excess can do. It implicitly
recognizes that knowledge is invented in the escape, in the excess. -- The Minor Gesture 38</aside>
  </p>

<p>The patterns and resonances in the piece require adjustments not only in
intensity but also in sequencing. Through heavy repetition, the timing of when
to select play on a video clip, where to queue the playhead of a clip for
beginning, and how to arrange the materials in the live performance has been
refined. In these interactions the sense of tuning zooms up to the level of the
human performer working with (and against) compositional materials. Pickering
casts these interactions in terms of tuning, and links them to accommodation and
resistance with materials as we engage with invention. "Such practice consists
in the recipricol tuning of human and material agency, tuning that can itself
reconfigure human intentions" (21). The shaping of human intentions can be seen
in the multiple capturings of the performances of the text. Each instance of the
text differs from others as subtle adjustments emerge in practice through "a
goal-oriented practice [that] takes the form of a <em>dance of agency</em>"
(21).</p>

<p>Further complicating these material and sonic tunings is the situational
context in which they play out. Whitehead notes that the feelings linked to
sonic materials are extended by the "complex ordered environment composed of
certain other actual entities which, however vaguely, is felt by reason of this
audition. This environment is the datum of this feeling. It is the external
world, as grasped systematically in this feeling" (324). Thomas Rickert
considers these contexts in terms of "attunement" as he outlines a model of
ambient rhetoric. While still subject to larger environmental situations, the
mixing of computer-based videos and materials recasts this context to allow the
composer to create and tune a sonic world within
the performative space of the computer screen
