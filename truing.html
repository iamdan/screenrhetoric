  <p>The video is a screen recording of a live performance that brought together
  and manipulated several media items. Three video windows with performances of
  the song, "Holocene," by Bon Iver appear. An iTunes window also plays an audio
  recording of the song. Additional videos with images of bubbles and
  information about bubbles and images of bicycle wheels appear. There are also
  several Sticky Note windows in which the cursor types during the performance. </p>

<p>00:00 The video opens with multiple windows on screen. A video hosted on
YouTube in the upper-left shows a male figure with a guitar. In the upper-right,
a video shows  a live performance of the song, "Holocene," by Bon Iver.
In the lower-right a video with a female figure holding a guitar
appears. In the lower-left, we see a video clip showing an old man on a beach
blowing enormous bubbles using two sticks and some string. The cursor selects
play on all of the materials. The cursor moves to the top of the screen and
brings forward an iTunes window containing an audio file of the live performance
of the song, "Holocene," by Bon Iver. The cursor selects play, and then a
visualizer is turned on, translating the iTunes window into a computer-generated
image of horizons, planets, and suns. </p>

<p>00:25. The figures in the YouTube videos begin speaking, offering
instruction on how to play the song: “uh, I’m going to try and explain how to
play Bon Iver’s. . . .” ; “Hello, YouTube! Um. . . .” The vocals in the live
performance of the song begin. The cursor moves to the right of the screen and
brings forward a sticky note window and begins to type: “We’re here to make an
idea real, a movie. It will be a moving thing that brings response. The
bee sting. The bicycle. Guitar string.” </p>

<p>01:17 The cursor brings forward a video clip in the lower-left of the screen
and selects play. An image of a spinning bicycle wheel in a truing frame
appears. The cursor moves back to the sticky note and continues typing: “The
shearsman strumming into being the bread and the stone, which links us
to craft, which leads us to art, which brings us to now.” </p>

<p>02:02 The cursor minimizes the sticky note and then brings a new sticky note
on screen and continues typing: “We nee[d] words like water. We need their
circulations for turning ideas, for truing them and bringing them into
tune, the way a wheel might speak through its spokes.” </p>

<p>02:40 In the bottom-left, the video of the man blowing large bubbles is
replaced by the video of the spinning bicycle wheel. For a moment, the
sticky note and its words are obscured, then it returns to the foreground and
the typing continues: ”Thus, we, too, give voice through the wire.
</p>

<p> 02:56 The cursor brings the video of the man making giant bubbles forward;
the turning wheel is no longer visible. The typing continues: We’re shifting
like sand or sea drifting over plates, like wetlines changing place with
the tides. We’re lifting. Collecting. Spacing. And repeating.
Gathering before coming ashore.

<p>03:42 The live performance of the song concludes its second verse and moves
into a soft instrumental segment. The cursor minimizes the second sticky note
and moves it off the screen. The cursor switches the positions of the videos
with male and female figures demonstrating how to play the song; the male voice
can be heard giving instructions: “on the sixth string, the third string, and
the second string. . . .” The woman’s voice is also briefly audible: “you just
kind of have to feel it out.” The live performance of the song is stopped. The
cursor brings forward the iTunes window and selects stop; without the music,
both guitar instructors’ voices are more audible, but their words overlap and
are difficult to discern.

<p>04:08 As the videos of guitar instruction and of a man truing a
bicycle wheel continue to play, the cursor brings a video describing the science of bubbles to
the foreground and selects play. The narrator in the science of bubbles video speaks: “There is a method to the
bubble madness that unlocks some pretty basic laws of nature. Law number one,
they act like a prism, reflecting the basic colors of the universe.” The woman teaching the Bon Iver song begins
singing softly in the background. An
interview voice in the science of bubbles video speaks: “White light coming in is actually composed of
all the colors in the rainbow and based on the thickness of the film, all the
different colors refract off in different ways, so just like a prism, we get the
whole spectrum in every bubble. The amazing thing to me is that when you look up
close it looks like bubbles are clear, but there is so much color going on.” A
second interview voice responds: "That is correct. It's every color of the
rainbow. I like to think that the colors are a map, showing you that the film is
thick in some places and thinner in others.” The science of bubbles video is
muted and the male guitarist can be heard: “he’s playing a lot of the same
notes, but . . . sometimes the length which some of the notes are held are
different. . . .”

<p>O5:03. The cursor rearranges videos on screen and then selects play on the
live performance of the song. The music—still soft—continues. The cursor brings
forward the iTunes window and selects play on the live performance of the song.
The song is now layered,  echoing due to the timing being slightly off on the
two performances. After a few seconds, the cursor turns down the sound on the
iTunes window and moves the window off the screen.

<p>05:34 The cursor brings a new sticky note to the screen and begins to type:
“Light casts movements like blue or green or blue and green. The
tracings are  breath or wind or liquid flowings like skin turning bubble and
returning wet with mind sight. The mixing laps at the overlaps of image,
song, word, or heard whisper from a front porch. Shh. . . .This is
important.”

<p>06:44 The live performance of the song concludes, and the cursor presses stop
on the video in the upper right. The audio from the guitar instructors is
audible; the man says “and, um, after he sings ‘magnificent’ there’s a little
pause for dramatic effect.” For a few seconds, both the man and woman sing
different parts of the song; their voices do not quite mesh. The video with
bubbles and bees moves to the upper-right corner of the screen. The cursor turns
up the sound on the science of bubbles video, brings forward another
sticky note, and begins to type: ”This is the healing of the split.
It’s the organic mechanic opening a window to say, we can change shapes,
we can move together as we do in this moment through the film.” </p>


<p> 07:15 In the science of bubbles video, the two interview voices
converse: “So there it is. It's pretty amazing. You think of it as one event,
instant event, but there you really see the tear. You never think of it as a
directional event. It just looks like it's there and it's gone.” The narrator of
the video speaks: “Watch the bubble burst again, even slower this time. . . .” The
male guitar player sings in vague falsetto. The narrator of the science of bubbles video continues, “There's
some complex science going on here. Surface tension holds the soap bubble
molecules together while the air inside the bubble forces them apart. When the
bubble begins to tear, soap molecules shoot out in all directions as tiny
droplets.” </p>

<p>08:05 The cursor brings a video on screen containing a male figure in front
of a bicycle wheel on a workbench. The cursor selects play and the figure begins
plucking the spokes and speaking: “After radially truing the rim, pluck a number
of spokes on the drive side and listen for the tone. . .” The ringing of the
spokes is barely audible over the speaking of the guitar instructors. The man
continues: “Then pluck a number of spokes on the non-drive side and also listen
for the tone.” The cursor lowers the sound of the video. </p>

<p> 08:40 The cursor increases the volume on the male guitarist video: “the
third verse, the Christmas-y verse, you want to slow down a bit and just play
long, languid notes and try to think of the suitable timing to hit the next bit
of the line.” The video is muted. In another video with the spinning bicycle wheel,
the narrator can be heard: “if you hear one that’s kind of like a clunk in there
then you’ll know that that one’s extra loose.” The cursor mutes that video, too.
The cursor slowly mutes the video of the woman playing and singing the Bon Iver
song. The video ends.

<div class="panel">


  <p>The video features four variations of live performances of the song,
  "Holocene," by Bon Iver. The core element is a recording
  captured on July 29th, 2011 that has been selected from numerous "concert
  videos" captured with mobile phones and posted on the YouTube web site. This video
  is played live in <em>Truing</em>, and a version of the song is also played
  using an audio player. Two additional versions of the song are also included in
  the piece. Both of these have been gathered from "how to play" videos hosted on
  YouTube. </p>

  <p>A number of other videos are used to provide visual and sonic materials. These include videos providing instruction on bicycle wheel truing as
  well as a video on the science of bubbles. All of these materials are
  excerpted and woven into the larger messaging of the poem.</p>

  <p><em>Truing</em> also includes a compilation video, or bubble track</a>
  (bubblescrashingandrolling.mp4) that brings together imagery of bees and flowers, waves and shorelines, and figures creating large soap
  bubbles. These materials have been sampled from numerous items hosted online.
  The video also includes a narrative track. The volume of the
  bubblescrashingandrolling video is turned down in the live performance of
  <em>Truing</em>, so no narration from the bubble track can be heard here; however, the <a href="https://vimeo.com/31461523">hidden narration</a> sheds light on the themes in the
  piece.</p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The fundamental tone, and its overtones, have,
each of them, their own intensities. This pattern of intensities can be analysed
into the relative intensities of the various tones and the absolute intensity
which is the total loudness. The scale of relative intensities enters into the
final quality of the note, with some independence of its absolute loudness.
<span class="attribution">Alfred North Whitehead, <strong>Process and
Reality</strong> (234)</span> </aside>

<p>This video was created as a model project for an  undergraduate writing
class. The assignment focused on media-oriented composing, but required that
videos include significant elements that bring words on screen. The piece was
further developed and included with the publication, <i>Watch the Bubble</i>, in
2012. It captures a live performance that includes manipulation
of multiple videos, an audio player, and live typing. </p>



<p>A core component of the performance is the mixing of sound. The primary
soundtrack is provided by a live performance of the song, "Holocene," by Bon
Iver. To create a sense of echoing, a second iteration of the song is woven into
the mix. The second iteration instantly creates an opportunity for tuning, as
the volume needs to be adjusted to open attention possibilities for other media. Similar adjustments must be made to the volume
levels of the "how-to" performances and other media elements.
Whitehead
notes that "relative intensities" must be weighed as we consider the feelings
associated with even a single note. This weighing of intensities is an apt model
for screen composing. Meaning emerges as elements accrue overtones and merge into harmonies.<p>

  <p>Such composing calls for "analysis [that] reveals an abstract qualitative
  pattern which is the complex relatedness of the fundamental tone-quality with
  the tone-qualities of its select overtones" (234). The audio elements in the
  piece call for this kind of co-emergent, intensity-based, layered,
  experiential reading. The call is amplified by the additive nature of the
  compositional method, combining more and more visual and sonic materials as
  the performance plays out. The two versions of the Bon Iver performance
  resonate with each other through adjustments in volume and timing. They
  similarly relate to the "how to" performances. Their relationship here, though
  is more adjacent, introducing distance and dissonance as well as similarity and resonance. The composing brings
  the similarities and differences together through tunings of intensities.<p>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> A speculative pragmatism takes as its starting point a rigor of experimentation.
It is interested in the anarchy at the heart of all process, and is
engaged with the techniques that tune the anarchical toward new modes
of knowledge and new modes of experience. It is also committed to what
escapes the order, and interested in what this excess can do. It implicitly
recognizes that knowledge is invented in the escape, in the excess. <span class="attribution">Erin Manning, <strong>The Minor Gesture</strong> (38)</span></aside>
  </p>

<p>The patterns and resonances in the piece derive from adjustments not only in
intensity but also in sequencing. Heavy repetition has refined the timing of
where to queue the playhead, when to select play on a video clip, and how to
arrange the materials in the live performance. In these interactions, the sense
of tuning is experienced by the human performer working with (and against)
compositional materials (that include words). Andrew Pickering links these
interactions to accommodation and resistance between humans and materials as we
engage with invention: "Such practice consists in the reciprocal tuning of human
and material agency, tuning that can itself reconfigure human intentions" (21).
The shaping of human intentions means the text of the
performed screen composition is never the same. Each instance differs from
others as subtle adjustments emerge through "a goal-oriented practice [that]
takes the form of a <em>dance of agency</em>" (21).</p>

<p>Further complicating these material and sonic tunings is their situational
context. Whitehead notes that the feelings linked to
sonic materials are extended by the "complex ordered environment composed of
certain other actual entities which, however vaguely, is felt by reason of this
audition. This environment is the datum of this feeling. It is the external
world, as grasped systematically in this feeling" (324). Thomas Rickert
considers these contexts in terms of "attunement" as he outlines a model of
ambient rhetoric. The
mixing of audiovisual materials recasts this context to allow the
composer to create a sonic world by tuning elements within
the performative environment of the computer screen.
