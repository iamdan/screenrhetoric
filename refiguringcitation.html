  <p>This video includes a number of videos in which students reflect on their
  use of materials in multimedia projects. These reflections include screen
  capturings of web sites and media projects. The video also shows quotations
  from scholarly articles and materials hosted by YouTube, including
  excerpts from a video produced by YouTube on fair use practices. </p>

  <p>00:00 The video opens with a title on screen: “(Re)Figuring Citation:
  Metaphors, Performance, and Transformative Use / Daniel Anderson
  iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan.” </p>

  <p>00:05 A web page with an embedded video appears on screen. The narrator
  speaks: “The video on screen captures YouTube’s content blocking system. I
  decided to include this because it happens all the time.” </p>

  <p>00:15 A title appears on screen: “First Metaphor: Private Property.” The
  title fades out and the video hosted by YouTube re-appears. The play button is selected
  and a message appears: “This video contains content from Warner Bros.
  Entertainment, who has blocked it on copyright grounds.” The narrator
  continues:  “We aim for fair use, and it's frustrating when a video—one crafted
  to evoke a feeling or convey a message, one that makes transformative use of
  materials, one that represents a good deal of creative investment—is blocked
  algorithmically by YouTube.” </p>

  <p>00:30 A detailed discussion posting remarking on the YouTube infringement
  algorithm fills the screen. The narrator continues: “The algorithm, it turns
  out, is very good at identifying the materials in a video.” </p>

  <p>00:40 A student video reflection appears on screen. It shows a video poem
  that features imagery of fishing. The student author narrates: “So
  that segment with the damselflies and the small blue winged olives, I thought
  that was . . . a really, really good segment to put in because, you know, these
  bugs, on the river, these insects, have such a finite life period. You know,
  they’re born in the water and they are literally swept up by the current. And
  they spend their days free-falling down the river, with no control over their
  path.” </p>

  <p>01:20 On screen, a cursor has been typing in a Sticky Note window to compose
  a quotation: “Writers commonly focused on . . . between 3 and 13 [criteria]
  when accounting for their citing decisions. . . . Different authors had
  different priorities, and one of the distinctions . . . was the authors’
  identification with the ‘researcher’ or ‘teacher’ role (Harwood 499).” On
  screen, the student video reflection plays and the student narration continues: “And in a lot of ways, that’s
  kind of how we feel as humans. But something that this sport provides us, that
  fishing provides us, that feeling of stableness and control, and being at
  peace. And so these bugs, they get above water for a few days and they lay
  their eggs, and they come back down and they die. And it’s a short existence,
  but they play this incredibly important role in the ecosystem of the river.
  And in that way, so do we as people.” </p>

  <p>02:00 On screen, a cursor has been typing on a translucent background to
  compose a quotation: “Citation is a private and subjective process, and
  motivations/functions cannot straightforwardly be read off by the textual
  analyst, however specialized his/her knowledge.  (Harwood 497).” </p>

  <p>02:02 A title appears on screen: “Second Metaphor: Favorites.” The title fades out and a browser with the YouTube web site appears. The phrase,
  “hd nature footage,” is entered in the YouTube search field, and various videos are selected.
  The narrator continues: “The narration about the damselfly comes from Thompson
  Long. I picked that clip because the voice really pulled me in and it speaks
  to what Nigel Harwood identifies as ‘decision-making criteria behind
  citation’--like crediting, supporting, and engaging.” </p>

  <p>02:23 On screen, a new student video reflection [by Kaitlyn]--capturing the
  act of composition using a video editor--is playing. It shows nature imagery
  that is part of a video poem and textual comments by the student that include
  the phrase, “Here are some of my favorites!” The narrator continues: “And
  Thompson's video extends these with a personal connection to fishing. Thompson
  is teaching as he discusses his video sources. The discussion of the sources
  creates a layer that operates on a meta level to those found in the composing
  space of the video editor, a layer to which has been applied an educational
  transformation. The YouTube algorithm—to my knowledge—doesn't check for that.”
  </p>

  <p>02:49 On screen, the student video reflection plays, with commentary or
  citation information appearing in a text box obscuring the bottom left of the
  video editor. The narrator continues: “And why should it? That's something
  produced through exchange. Reading is not a disenchanted parsing of a fixed,
  original text. It's a prosumer process, where we copy to view and perform to
  read. And that's not to say the algorithm is unhelpful. In fact, it's the kind
  of thing that might transform the way we work with sources. We can filter,
  sort, list, even cite with the machine as we turn toward the thoughts and
  feelings associated with the materials. Why not a meta-container for personal
  meaning?” </p>

  <p>03:24 On screen, a student
  reflection appears, showing a number of web screens, such as a March Madness
  bracket and a Facebook posting. The student narrator [Smriti] begins speaking: “So I actually first heard this poem through
  a contest that my tenth grade class held. And the poem that won was 'I Wondered
  as Lonely as a Cloud.' And I remember each day we heard the poem, it was
  recited by my good friend, Heather. This is Heather right here. And just the
  way she spoke, the way she portrayed this poem, if I were to imagine a
  daffodil as a person it would definitely be Heather.” </p>

  <p>03:53 On screen a new student video reflection appears, showing a video
  composing program. The student narrator [Emily] speaks: “This video
  was filmed in Australia, which is where I was born, so right off the bat I
  felt an emotional connection to this piece. Throughout a lot of the video you
  can see the drone that’s carrying the camera, so I had to find a segment that
  didn’t show the drone so that it would not interfere with the theme of birds
  and being free. Something about the drone being visible in the shot took away
  from the symbolic meaning of the poem. I also just couldn’t believe how high
  up the drone could fly and the beautiful sights it captured. I felt like this
  video perfectly captured the sentiment I was going for, of feeling liberated,
  because of the gradual rise of the camera and how it looked down on the earth
  below. In this instance, I don’t feel like my use of the artist’s work
  devalued theirs. Hopefully this is another case of enhancing the value of
  another artist’s work, and using the concept of intertextuality to create
  something new and beautiful.” </p>

  <p>04:56 A white screen appears and the cursor begins to type across the top. The
  narrator continues: “The clips we just watched all required decisions about
  materials. I like that Kaitlyn ‘gave nods’ to her favorite movies. And I chose
  that clip, because it uses text callouts to discuss its materials. The lack of
  sound in the clip allowed me to engage with Thompson's video and speaks to the
  challenges of managing attention. Too much typing and noise at the same time,
  and it's hard to focus.” </p>

  <p>05:25 On screen, the cursor has typed out a quotation: “Digital craft
  criticism imagines what choices made at the material level contribute not only
  to the interpretation of the text that requires reading, watching and
  listening, but, more important, the limits and horizons that particular
  material conditions in digital environments make possible for imaginative
  texts (Koehler 395).” The narrator continues: "I like that Smriti chose her
  subject based on a happy memory of her good friend. And I like the way Emily
  points toward her personal connection with a video from Australia and guides
  us through the difficulties (and rewards) that came from working with the
  clip. And I like how Emily's discussion calls for new approaches when it comes
  to citation of time-based materials. Her discussion of the changing camera
  height and an emerging sense of freedom makes me wonder how to link such
  insights to a citational reference. And I wonder about the affordances of
  multimedia, as Emily unpacks the clip, bringing words back to the citational
  video even as they reveal the abstract and ambiguous richness--and
  limitations--of the moving visuals beneath." </p>

  <p>06:12 A title appears on screen: “Third Metaphor: Listening.” On screen, a
  new student video reflection appears, showing multiple web tabs and including
  narration by the student author: “I came across this and I said, you know, this is
  promising, make your own lanyard. And it wasn’t exactly what I wanted but it
  did have a song that I decided I fell in love with.” </p>

  <p>06:27 In the student video reflection, the opening of the song, “Thieves and
  Kings,” begins to play. On screen, a cursor typing in a callout box has composed a
  quotation: Advocating a context-is-the-new-content approach to the
  understanding of creative writing, Goldsmith proposes what he calls uncreative
  writing: "focused on . . . ‘manipulation’ and ‘management’ of the heaps of
  already existent and ever-increasing language" (Koehler 390). The narration
  of the student author continues: “So obviously this wasn’t a very good video
  PSA, but I loved the song. So I decided to rip this video and I used the song
  for my e-poem.” </p>

  <p>06:48 The callout fades out and a new student video reflection appears. It
  shows a video hosted by YouTube, titled “Brian Eno – The Big Ship – DOTS extended
  edit.” The student author narrates the video: “So whenever I hear this piece of
  music I imagine all the millions of people in the world all kind of focused in
  on their own complicated lives but still somehow connected. I found this to be
  a really powerful feeling, but I wasn’t sure I would be able to find a poem
  that communicated the same ideas. So as silly as it sounds, I ended up
  Googling ‘poetry about the vivid complexity of life’ and found exactly what I
  was looking for.” </p>

  <p>07:20 A title appears on screen: “Fourth Metaphor: Mixing.” The title fades
  out and a cursor begins typing on screen. The narrator continues: “I'd like to
  add a category to our citational metadata: ‘suggested musical accompaniment.’
  Those clips are just two of many discussing musical choices. And each reveals
  how an association adds nuance to a source. And we can make those associations
  on multiple levels—from the information-based, machine-generated to the
  conceptual, human-created; from file names, timestamps, and edition numbers to
  whatever we might think to link up and assign—music, meanings, meanderings.”
  On screen, the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: “When composers use
  multiple modes as tools for thinking rather than just to visually illustrate a
  completed script, they actually generate new meaning. Creation of a digital
  video then can become much more than an act of ‘translation’ or transcription. . . .
  Compositing and new recursivity . . . are also critical cognitive experiences. . . .
  (Fulwiler and Middleton 44).” </p>

  <p>08:04 A new student video reflection appears on screen. It alternates
  between a view of a video editor and close-up imagery of clouds. It includes
  narration by the student author: “I searched high and low for the obvious
  footage: some clouds. This is when I had a little breakthrough in regards to
  the meaning of the poem. It’s a very outside/in type of work, using the
  analogy of a fishing trip on the scale of the whole world. Sometimes you’re a
  fisherman; you’re in control and you see everything clearly. Other times,
  you’re the fish. I tried to incorporate this dual-nature into my e-poem, and I
  began by using a clip that makes the viewer seem powerful, as if the whole
  world is in his or her hands. This series of first clips open the video in a
  strong way, immediately alerting the viewer that there is something really
  weighty and significant discussed in this poem.” </p>

  <p>08:40 A new student video reflection appears on screen, also featuring a
  video editor and narration by the student author: “So the next stanza here
  begins with a change in speakers, so now the mirror is a lake, and I picked a
  droplet of water that I slowed down to be the background for these words. And,
  as the words ‘a woman bends over me’ fade in, so does a clip of a woman who
  barely, slowly begins to open her eyes. And I scaled the clip of the woman and
  placed her so that the water droplet is right on her eye, and as it drops, her
  eye opens. So, um, let’s see. I can show right here as it hits, her eyes open
  up with the ripple.” </p>

  <p>09:24 A new student video reflection appears, likewise showing a video
  editor and including narration: “I added in this clip of the bird chirping.
  And then at the end I added the other clip of a bird chirping, after the music
  had faded out. So it’s a completely different song; it’s not created by a
  human. It’s the song that he is referring to, which is the bird.” </p>

  <p>09:54 A title appears on screen: “Last Metaphor: Resistance.” A cursor
  appears on screen and begins typing. The narrator continues: “These videos
  reveal the rich metadata that comes from capturing decision-making about
  sources. Amy shows how spending time with materials yields insights. Nicole
  links clips to composing decisions. Hannah points toward the relationship
  between humans and nonhumans. And all of the videos demonstrate the
  transformational possibilities of working with mixings of materials. So what
  does this mean as we move citation into the digital age?” On screen, the cursor
  has completed typing out a quotation: “Only the humanities and social science
  articles . . . contained reporting verbs characterizing the source as
  unreliable (e.g., fail, overlook, exaggerate, or ignore). This is attributed
  to the ‘more disputational style of argument’ (p. 362) found in the soft
  knowledge fields (Harwood 500).” </p>

  <p>10:30 The quotation fades out and a cursor appears on screen and begins
  typing. The narrator continues: “Citations have the potential for transforming
  or reinscribing values. Harwood found motivations for citations were more
  confrontational in the humanities. Fulwiler and Middleton note the hold that
  old logics have upon new media, recasting potential disruptions within linear
  paradigms. Intellectual cut-throating and values linked to fixed, linear
  logics: Pass. Perhaps if working with rich mixings of materials holds promise,
  reworking those workings with meta-level, process-oriented citations and
  responses can move us toward further transformations.” </p>

  <p>11:09 On screen, the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: “The
  current model of digital video composing as a sequential series of
  temporally-discrete steps is predicated on the logic of old media and, thus,
  may no longer be sufficient to account for the new media composing processes
  that emerge with new media interfaces (Fulwiler and Middleton 40).” </p>

  <p> 11:11 The quotation fades out and a new student video reflection appears
  on screen. It shows a project in a video editor and includes narration by the
  student author: “I found this video on Vimeo and it’s from Matt Wood. And I
  found the visual aspect of this video to be extremely compelling because you
  get to see a bird flying in slow motion, which is not something you see
  everyday. It’s also interesting that the bird flies so close to the ground and
  seems to stay in place for a long time. This video made me think of
  Dickinson’s first stanza, that describes a feeling of being trapped and almost
  passive. I did feel a sense of guilt in borrowing this cinematographer’s work
  without permission. The work is absolutely stunning, and I felt like not
  enough credit was given to him. However, I do not feel like my incorporation
  of his work devalues it, which is a principle of ‘fair use.’ I also feel like
  incorporating his work enhanced the meaning of the Dickinson poem, which vibes
  with the concept of ‘intertextuality’: that all texts have a relationship to
  each other in some way.” </p>

  <p>12:12 The student video reflection fades out and a cursor appears on screen
  and begins typing. The narrator continues: “I put more of Emily's video in the
  presentation because she is thinking deeply about use decisions. So much of
  her commentary offers the rich, human-oriented metadata that might build upon
  traditional or informational citation. In this way, the expansion and
  liberation she describes in her materials become a mode of resistance through
  creativity, through pushing writing in the digital age. To evaluate the power
  of such pushing, consider one final reference to YouTube: a video entitled
  ‘YouTube copyright school.’” On screen the cursor has completed typing a
  quotation: “Craft criticism . . . foregrounds textual production while
  backgrounding textual interpretation. . . . Craft criticism uses methods of
  production to examine the ways imaginative literature operates—and how it can
  help its authors and audience members engage critically with the cultural
  environment that surrounds them (Koehler 381-382).” </p>

  <p>12:48 On screen, the quotation fades out and an excerpt from the video,
  “YouTube Copyright School,” appears. The video contains animated
  characters and the following narration: “Oh Russell, your use of Lumpy’s
  content is clever, but did you get permission for it? Mashups or remixes of
  content may also require permission from the original copyright owner,
  depending on whether or not the use is a ‘fair use.’” </p>

  <p>13:02 On screen, in the excerpt from the "YouTube Copyright School" video, a
  bubble appears with a cursor typing. In the video clip, the tempo of the
  speech increases drastically, pharmaceutical-commercial style, as the
  narration continues: “In the United States, copyright allows for the fair use
  of copyrighted material under certain limited circumstances without prior
  permission from the owner. Under the law, determinations of fair use take into
  account the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted
  work, the amount and substantiality of the work use in relation to the work as
  a whole, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the
  copyrighted work. Other jurisdictions may have similar copyright provisions
  protecting fair use or fair dealing. If you are uncertain as to whether a
  specific use qualifies as a fair use, you should consult a qualified copyright
  attorney.” </p>

  <p>13:24 On screen, the excerpt from "YouTube Copyright School" fades out and a
  close up of a bird in flight from a student video project appears. The
  narrator speaks with an extremely fast pace: “I decided to use the excerpt
  from YouTube copyright school. . . .“ </p>

  <p>13:28 The narrator continues at a normal pace: “. . .because it's so rich
  with irony. Listen to the clip and you hear an example of how not to use
  multimedia. Too much typing and noise, and it’s hard to focus. The pacing of
  the typed display, the pharmaceutical disclaimer voiceover, the banging and
  clanging all combine to say, pay no attention to the way you use the materials
  of others. In fact, don’t even try it. How to respond?” </p>

  <p>13:59 On screen, a student video poem plays, accompanied by the song, “Head
  Full of Doubt.” by the Avett Brothers. The video shows flocks of birds and single
  birds flying. The singer sings: “There was a dream and one day I could see it.
  Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it. And there
  was a kid with a head full of doubt. So I'll scream ‘til I die and the last of
  those bad thoughts are finally out.” </p>

  <p>14:24 The music fades out. On screen a list of works cited scrolls. The
  video ends. </p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> The centuries preceding the industrial era were
characterized by a more complex and interactive relationship between creators
and their audiences. . . . This changed quickly and dramatically with the rise
of modern technologies such as the phonograph, the radio, and the cinema. The
mass production and distribution of culture required a more passive form of
consumption <span class="attribution">Jeff Howe, <strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> (178) </span></aside>

<p>This video was created for the 2016 Modern Language Association Convention,
where the narration was performed as part of a panel on new practices for
citation. Citation creates a continuum when we weave
materials into projects. On one end, citations are evidential markers and links
to sources--works cited. On another end, they are the stuff of thought, as
composers bring together materials and mix them into projects. And this
continuum is multi-channeled, with legal, ethical, compositional, and
cultural concerns layered and ranging over one another as we work with sources. Screen
composing adds more layers, for audiovisuals, for motion, for genres, for
creative production.  </p>

<p>Citation reveals how screen composing extends from and pushes against
behaviors built on print mindsets. The norms that govern the use of materials
for print, "we all take for granted," Lawrence Lessig explains. How those norms
apply to media is an open question, with one possible response resulting in "the
norms of 'quote freely, with attribution' spread from text to music and film"
(55). Lessig offers a legal or ethical frame for tracing the use-boundaries
between print and media. A practice like screen composing recasts acceptable
uses like "the right to quote" (55). Behaviors based on print meet in remix an
active testing of new modes of thinking and writing that use borrowing, loops,
and repurposing to bring together images, sounds and words. Print protocols and
logics warn of the surface-level attention linked with quickly mixed citations,
what Rebecca Moore-Howard calls "patchwriting." Screen composing responds by
making quick mixing a fundamental inventive move. Clearly, these intellectual
and inventive demands create an excess that surpasses print-based citation practices.</p>



<p> The response offered by screen composing extends the patching together of
materials to include images, words, and sounds. These kinds of shifts and their
associated disruptions are not new. Gilles Deleuze traces similar changes tied to
the integration of sound into cinema. Citing Godard, he notes that adding sound
does not create a new, separate layer to accompany images; rather it alters the
nature of images themselves as "mixing ousts montage, it being understood that
mixing does not just consist of a distribution of the different sound elements,
but the allocation of their differential relations with the visual elements"
(175).</p>

voices from other texts, other codes), whose vanishing point is nonetheless
ceaselessly pushed back, mysteriously opened: each (single) text is the very
theory (and not the mere example) of this vanishing. <span

<p>Remixing in multimedia is complicated, because images not only are themselves
amalgams of visual, sonic, verbal, and time-based activity but also must be
understood in terms of the interstices between the items. "It is not a matter of
following a chain of images, even across voids, but of getting out of the chain
or the association" (Deleuze 174). In terms of decision making related to materials,
this cinematic modality moves students into boundary spaces where this
shaping plays out. As Deleuze puts it, "the interaction of two images engenders
or traces a frontier which belongs to neither one nor the other" (175). With screen composing, like the cinema Deleuze imagines, even a citation as
simple as integrating a clip into a video becomes layered and recasts
 boundaries as a circuit of movement among materials (both within and without the video) emerges. </p>

<p>Needless to say, these movements challenge students to define themselves as
screen composers. Digital craft criticism, Adam Koehler suggests, "foregrounds
textual production while backgrounding textual interpretation" (381). This
production requires imagining a new ethos that enables "authors to experiment
with the different kinds of author/ity that emerge when hybridizing and
modifying genres" (392). This ethos might deploy the kinds of approaches that
Deleuze links with cinema and that imply "a new conception of cutting, a whole
'pedagogy' which will operate in different ways" (22). A pedagogy for screen
composing calls for a "camera-consciousness" that, Deleuze suggests, "would no
longer be defined by the movements [the camera] is able to follow or make, but
by the mental connections it is able to enter into" (22). This consciousness
emerges in the spaces of conjunction, the interstices where we find
"questioning, responding, objecting, provoking, theorematizing, hypothesizing,
experimenting" (22). In terms of citation practices, the student videos in
<em>(Re)figuring Citation</em>  offer examples of students articulating a
networked, camera-conscious ethos as they reflect on decision-making associated
with these frontier spaces of screen composing.
