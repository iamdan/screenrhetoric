    This video was created for the 2016 Modern Language Association Convention,
    where it was performed as part of a panel on new practices for citation. A
    partial audio track was recorded, and then the narrator spoke over that
    track for the academic presentation. Afterwards, a final narrative track
    was recorded for the version included here.
</p>
<p>
    This piece shows a number of videos in which students reflect on their use
    of materials in multimedia projects. These reflections include screen
    capturings of websites and media projects. The video also shows quotations
    from scholarly articles and materials hosted by YouTube, including excerpts
    from a video produced by YouTube on fair use practices. The narrative track
    guides the viewers through these materials.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

  <p>
    00:00 The video opens with a title on screen: "(Re)Figuring Citation:
    Metaphors, Performance, and Transformative Use / Daniel Anderson
    iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan."
</p>
<p>
    00:05 A web page with an embedded video appears on screen. The narrator
    speaks: "The video on screen captures YouTube's content blocking system. I
    decided to include this because it happens all the time."
</p>
<p>
    00:15 A title appears on screen: "First Metaphor: Private Property." The
    title fades out and the video hosted by YouTube reappears. The play button
    is selected and a message appears: "This video contains content from Warner
    Bros. Entertainment, who has blocked it on copyright grounds." The narrator
    continues: "We aim for fair use, and it's frustrating when a video—one
    crafted to evoke a feeling or convey a message, one that makes
    transformative use of materials, one that represents a good deal of
    creative investment—is blocked algorithmically by YouTube."
</p>
<p>
    00:30 A detailed discussion posting remarking on the YouTube infringement
    algorithm fills the screen: "I'm not ranting about my videos being removed.
    I'm just surprised how effective the content censor is. I'm wondering how
    the algorithm correctly identifies the song as infringing copyright even
    after all my efforts to circumvent it." The narrator continues: "The
    algorithm, it turns out, is very good at identifying the materials in a
    video."
</p>
<p>
    00:40 A student video reflection appears on screen. It shows a video poem
    that features imagery of fishing. The student author narrates: "So that
    segment with the damselflies and the small blue winged olives, I thought
    that was . . . a really, really good segment to put in because, you know,
    these bugs, on the river, these insects, have such a finite life period.
    You know, they're born in the water and they are literally swept up by the
    current. And they spend their days free-falling down the river, with no
    control over their path."
</p>
<p>
    01:20 On screen, a cursor has been typing in a Sticky Note window to
    compose a quotation: "Writers commonly focused on . . . between 3 and 13
    [criteria] when accounting for their citing decisions. . . . Different
    authors had different priorities, and one of the distinctions . . . was the
    authors' identification with the 'researcher' or 'teacher' role (Harwood
    499)." On screen, the student video reflection plays and the student
    narration continues: "And in a lot of ways, that's kind of how we feel as
    humans. But something that this sport provides us, that fishing provides
    us, that feeling of stableness and control, and being at peace. And so
    these bugs, they get above water for a few days and they lay their eggs,
    and they come back down and they die. And it's a short existence, but they
    play this incredibly important role in the ecosystem of the river. And in
    that way, so do we as people."
</p>
<p>
    02:00 On screen, a cursor has been typing on a translucent background to
    compose a quotation: "Citation is a private and subjective process, and
    motivations/functions cannot straightforwardly be read off by the textual
    analyst, however specialized his/her knowledge (Harwood 497)."
</p>
<p>
    02:02 A title appears on screen: "Second Metaphor: Favorites." The title
    fades out and the browser with the YouTube website appears. The phrase, "hd
    nature footage," is entered in the YouTube search field, and various videos
    are selected. The narrator continues: "The narration about the damselfly
    comes from Thompson Long. I picked that clip because the voice really
    pulled me in and it speaks to what Nigel Harwood identifies as
    'decision-making criteria behind citation'—like crediting, supporting, and
    engaging."
</p>
<p>
    02:23 On screen, a new student video reflection (by Kaitlyn)—capturing the
    act of composition using a video editor—is playing. It shows nature imagery
    that is part of a video poem and textual comments by the student that
    include the phrase "Here are some of my favorites!" The narrator continues:
    "And Thompson's video extends these with a personal connection to fishing.
    Thompson is teaching as he discusses his video sources. The discussion of
    the sources creates a layer that operates on a meta level to those found in
    the composing space of the video editor, a layer to which has been applied
    an educational transformation. The YouTube algorithm—to my
    knowledge—doesn't check for that."
</p>
<p>
    02:49 On screen, the student video reflection plays, with commentary or
    citation information appearing in a text box obscuring the bottom left of
    the video editor. The narrator continues: "And why should it? That's
    something produced through exchange. Reading is not a disenchanted parsing
    of a fixed, original text. It's a prosumer process, where we copy to view
    and perform to read. And that's not to say the algorithm is unhelpful. In
    fact, it's the kind of thing that might transform the way we work with
    sources. We can filter, sort, list, even cite with the machine as we turn
    toward the thoughts and feelings associated with the materials. Why not a
    metacontainer for personal meaning?"
</p>
<p>
    03:24 On screen, a student reflection appears, showing a number of web
    screens, including a March Madness bracket and a Facebook posting. The
    student narrator (Smriti) begins speaking: "So I actually first heard this
    poem through a contest that my tenth-grade class held. And the poem that
    won was 'I Wondered as Lonely as a Cloud.' And I remember each day we heard
    the poem, it was recited by my good friend, Heather. This is Heather right
    here. And just the way she spoke, the way she portrayed this poem, if I
    were to imagine a daffodil as a person it would definitely be Heather."
</p>
<p>
    03:53 On screen, a new student reflection appears, showing a video
    composing program. The student narrator (Emily) speaks: "This video was
    filmed in Australia, which is where I was born, so right off the bat I felt
    an emotional connection to this piece. Throughout a lot of the video you
    can see the drone that's carrying the camera, so I had to find a segment
    that didn't show the drone so that it would not interfere with the theme of
    birds and being free. Something about the drone being visible in the shot
    took away from the symbolic meaning of the poem. I also just couldn't
    believe how high up the drone could fly and the beautiful sights it
    captured. I felt like this video perfectly captured the sentiment I was
    going for, of feeling liberated, because of the gradual rise of the camera
    and how it looked down on the earth below. In this instance, I don't feel
    like my use of the artist's work devalued theirs. Hopefully, this is
    another case of enhancing the value of another artist's work, and using the
    concept of intertextuality to create something new and beautiful."
</p>
<p>
    04:56 A white screen appears and the cursor begins to type across the top.
    The narrator continues: "The clips we just watched all required decisions
    about materials. I like that Kaitlyn 'gave nods' to her favorite movies.
    And I chose that clip, because it uses text callouts to discuss its
    materials. The lack of sound in the clip allowed me to engage with
    Thompson's video and speaks to the challenges of managing attention. Too
    much typing and noise at the same time, and it's hard to focus."
</p>
<p>
    05:25 On screen, the cursor has typed out a quotation: "Digital craft
    criticism imagines what choices made at the material level contribute not
    only to the interpretation of the text that requires reading, watching and
    listening, but, more important, the limits and horizons that particular
    material conditions in digital environments make possible for imaginative
    texts (Koehler 395)." The narrator continues: "I like that Smriti chose her
    subject based on a happy memory of her good friend. And I like the way
    Emily points toward her personal connection with a video from Australia and
    guides us through the difficulties (and rewards) that came from working
    with the clip. And I like how Emily's discussion calls for new approaches
    when it comes to citation of time-based materials. Her discussion of the
    changing camera height and an emerging sense of freedom makes me wonder how
    to link such insights to a citational reference. And I wonder about the
    affordances of multimedia, as Emily unpacks the clip, bringing words back
    to the citational video even as they reveal the abstract and ambiguous
    richness—and limitations—of the moving visuals beneath."
</p>
<p>
    06:12 A title appears on screen: "Third Metaphor: Listening." On screen, a
    new student video reflection appears, showing multiple web tabs and
    including narration by the student author: "I came across this and I said,
    you know, this is promising, make your own lanyard. And it wasn't exactly
    what I wanted but it did have a song that I decided I fell in love with."
</p>
<p>
    06:27 In the student video reflection, the opening of the song "Thieves and
    Kings" begins to play. On screen, a cursor typing in a callout box has
    composed a quotation: "Advocating a context-is-the-new-content approach to
    the understanding of creative writing, Goldsmith proposes what he calls
    uncreative writing: 'focused on . . . "manipulation" and "management" of
    the heaps of already existent and ever-increasing language'" (Koehler 390).
    The narration of the student author continues: "So obviously this wasn't a
    very good video PSA, but I loved the song. So I decided to rip this video
    and I used the song for my e-poem."
</p>
<p>
    06:48 The callout fades out and a new student reflection appears. It shows
    a video hosted by YouTube titled "Brian Eno—The Big Ship—DOTS Extended
    Edit." The student author narrates: "So whenever I hear this piece of music
    I imagine all the millions of people in the world all kind of focused in on
    their own complicated lives but still somehow connected. I found this to be
    a really powerful feeling, but I wasn't sure I would be able to find a poem
    that communicated the same ideas. So, as silly as it sounds, I ended up
    googling 'poetry about the vivid complexity of life' and found exactly what
    I was looking for."
</p>
<p>
    07:20 A title appears on screen: "Fourth Metaphor: Mixing." The title fades
    out and a cursor begins typing on screen. The narrator continues: "I'd like
    to add a category to our citational metadata: 'suggested musical
    accompaniment.' Those clips are just two of many discussing musical
    choices. And each reveals how an association adds nuance to a source. And
    we can make those associations on multiple levels: from the
    information-based, machine-generated to the conceptual, human-created; from
    file names, timestamps, and edition numbers to whatever we might think to
    link up and assign—music, meanings, meanderings." On screen, the cursor has
    completed typing out a quotation: "When composers use multiple modes as
    tools for thinking rather than just to visually illustrate a completed
    script, they actually generate new meaning. Creation of a digital video
    then can become much more than an act of 'translation' or transcription. .
    . . Compositing and new recursivity . . . are
    also critical cognitive experiences. . . . (Fulwiler and Middleton 44)."
</p>
<p>
    08:04 A new student reflection appears on screen. It alternates between a
    view of a video editor and close-up imagery of clouds. It includes
    narration by the student author: "I searched high and low for the obvious
    footage: some clouds. This is when I had a little breakthrough in regards
    to the meaning of the poem. It's a very outside/in type of work, using the
    analogy of a fishing trip on the scale of the whole world. Sometimes you're
    a fisherman; you're in control and you see everything clearly. Other times,
    you're the fish. I tried to incorporate this dual nature into my e-poem,
    and I began by using a clip that makes the viewer seem powerful, as if the
    whole world is in his or her hands. This series of first clips open the
    video in a strong way, immediately alerting the viewer that there is
    something really weighty and significant discussed in this poem."
</p>
<p>
    08:40 A new student reflection appears on screen, also featuring a video
    editor and narration by the student author: "So the next stanza here begins
    with a change in speakers, so now the mirror is a lake, and I picked a
    droplet of water that I slowed down to be the background for these words.
    And, as the words 'a woman bends over me' fade in, so does a clip of a
    woman who barely, slowly begins to open her eyes. And I scaled the clip of
    the woman and placed her so that the water droplet is right on her eye, and
    as it drops, her eye opens. So, um, let's see. I can show right here as it
    hits, her eyes open up with the ripple."
</p>
<p>
    09:24 A new student reflection appears, likewise showing a video editor and
    including narration: "I added in this clip of the bird chirping. And then
    at the end I added the other clip of a bird chirping, after the music had
    faded out. So it's a completely different song; it's not created by a
    human. It's the song that he is referring to, which is the bird."
</p>
<p>
    09:54 A title appears on screen: "Last Metaphor: Resistance." A cursor
    appears on screen and begins typing. The narrator continues: "These videos
    reveal the rich metadata that comes from capturing decision-making about
    sources. Amy shows how spending time with materials yields insights. Nicole
    links clips to composing decisions. Hannah points toward the relationship
    between humans and nonhumans. And all of the videos demonstrate the
    transformational possibilities of working with mixings of materials. So
    what does this mean as we move citation into the digital age?" On screen,
    the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: "Only the humanities and
    social science articles . . . contained reporting verbs characterizing the
    source as unreliable (e.g., fail, overlook, exaggerate, or ignore). This is
    attributed to the 'more disputational style of argument' (p. 362) found in
    the soft knowledge fields (Harwood 500)."
</p>
<p>
    10:30 The quotation fades out and a cursor appears on screen and begins
    typing. The narrator continues: "Citations have the potential for
    transforming or reinscribing values. Harwood found motivations for
    citations were more confrontational in the humanities. Fulwiler and
    Middleton note the hold that old logics have upon new media, recasting
    potential disruptions within linear paradigms. Intellectual cut-throating
    and values linked to fixed, linear logics: Pass. Perhaps if working with
    rich mixings of materials holds promise, reworking those workings with
    meta-level, process-oriented citations and responses can move us toward
    further transformations."
</p>
<p>
    11:09 On screen, the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: "The
    current model of digital video composing as a sequential series of
    temporally-discrete steps is predicated on the logic of old media and,
    thus, may no longer be sufficient to account for the new media composing
    processes that emerge with new media interfaces (Fulwiler and Middleton
    40)."
</p>
<p>
    11:11 The quotation fades out and a new student video reflection appears on
    screen. It shows a project in a video editor and includes narration by the
    student author: "I found this video on Vimeo and it's from Matt Wood. And I
    found the visual aspect of this video to be extremely compelling because
    you get to see a bird flying in slow motion, which is not something you see
    every day. It's also interesting that the bird flies so close to the ground
    and seems to stay in place for a long time. This video made me think of
    Dickinson's first stanza, that describes a feeling of being trapped and
    almost passive. I did feel a sense of guilt in borrowing this
    cinematographer's work without permission. The work is absolutely stunning,
    and I felt like not enough credit was given to him. However, I do not feel
    like my incorporation of his work devalues it, which is a principle of
    'fair use.' I also feel like incorporating his work enhanced the meaning of
    the Dickinson poem, which vibes with the concept of 'intertextuality': that
    all texts have a relationship to each other in some way."
</p>
<p>
    12:12 The student video reflection fades out and a cursor appears on screen
    and begins typing. The narrator continues: "I put more of Emily's video in
    the presentation because she is thinking deeply about use decisions. So
    much of her commentary offers the rich, human-oriented metadata that might
    build upon traditional or informational citation. In this way, the
    expansion and liberation she describes in her materials become a mode of
    resistance through creativity, through pushing writing in the digital age.
    To evaluate the power of such pushing, consider one final reference to
    YouTube: a video entitled 'YouTube copyright school.'" On screen, the
    cursor has completed typing a quotation: "Craft criticism . . . foregrounds
    textual production while backgrounding textual interpretation. . . . Craft
    criticism uses methods of production to examine the ways imaginative
    literature operates—and how it can help its authors and audience members
    engage critically with the cultural environment that surrounds them
    (Koehler 381–382)."
</p>
<p>
    12:48 On screen, the quotation fades out and an excerpt from the video
    "YouTube Copyright School" appears. The video contains animated characters
    and the following narration: "Oh, Russell, your use of Lumpy's content is
    clever, but did you get permission for it? Mashups or remixes of content
    may also require permission from the original copyright owner, depending on
    whether or not the use is a 'fair use.'"
</p>
<p>
    13:02 On screen, in the excerpt from the "YouTube Copyright School" video,
    a callout appears with a cursor typing. In the video clip, the tempo of the
    speech increases drastically, pharmaceutical-commercial style, as the
    narration continues: "In the United States, copyright allows for the fair
    use of copyrighted material under certain limited circumstances without
    prior permission from the owner. Under the law, determinations of fair use
    take into account the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the
    copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the work used in
    relation to the work as a whole, and the effect of the use upon the
    potential market for the copyrighted work. Other jurisdictions may have
    similar copyright provisions protecting fair use or fair dealing. If you
    are uncertain as to whether a specific use qualifies as a fair use, you
    should consult a qualified copyright attorney."
</p>
<p>
    13:24 On screen, the excerpt from "YouTube Copyright School" fades out and
    a close-up of a bird in flight from a student video project appears. The
    narrator speaks with an extremely fast pace: "I decided to use the excerpt
    from YouTube copyright school. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    13:28 The narrator continues at a normal pace: "because it's so rich with
    irony. Listen to the clip and you hear an example of how not to use
    multimedia. Too much typing and noise, and it's hard to focus. The pacing
    of the typed display, the pharmaceutical disclaimer voiceover, the banging
    and clanging all combine to say, pay no attention to the way you use the
    materials of others. In fact, don't even try it. How to respond?"
</p>
<p>
    13:59 On screen, a student video poem plays, accompanied by the song "Head
    Full of Doubt" by the Avett Brothers. The video shows flocks of birds and
    single birds flying. The singer sings: "There was a dream and one day I
    could see it / Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody
    free it / And there was a kid with a head full of doubt / So I'll scream
    'til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out."
</p>
<p>
    14:24 The music fades out. On screen, a list of works cited scrolls. The
    video ends.

    The bulk of this piece is made up of student videos. These videos use
    screen recording to capture aspects of class projects. They also include
    reflections by the students that provide both source information and
    insights into decisions made while composing. The reflections bring to the
    surface concerns related to the use of materials in media projects.
</p>
<p>
    A video produced by YouTube called "YouTube Copyright School" is also
    excerpted. <em>Refiguring Citation</em> also includes images scanned from
    the <em>MLA Handbook</em> for documenting citations. The video also
    provides textual callouts or on-screen typing with quotations. Excerpts
    speak to citation practices in terms of digital composing.

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left">The centuries preceding the industrial era were characterized by a more
    complex and interactive relationship between creators and their audiences.
    . . . This changed quickly and dramatically with the rise of modern
    technologies such as the phonograph, the radio, and the cinema. The mass
    production and distribution of culture required a more passive form of
    consumption. <span class="attribution">Jeff Howe, <span class="attribution-title">Crowdsourcing</span> (178) </span></aside>

<p>
    In 2016, the Modern Language Association released an updated version of its
    handbook for source documentation style. For years, citing sources was
    often cast as mechanical, and handbooks primarily provided instructions for
    documenting and formatting references. The new version asked writers to
    extend those aims to address emerging media, focusing on essential traits
    of materials like titles, authors, and dates, and then determining how to
    provide that information in ways useful to readers. In this way, the
    handbook asked writers to become agile, knowing that "a work in a new
    medium thus can be documented without new instructions" (3). The
    professional organization for language and literature had embraced
    networked and digital writing.
</p>
<p>
    Composing for the screen bridges familiar and emerging practices as we
    trace the materials we bring into projects. On one end of a continuum,
    citations are evidential records of sources—works cited. On another end,
    they are markers and composited layers of shared materials, contexts, even
    ideas. As writers work with images, sounds, and words, distinctions between
    excerpt and citation, original and copy, or source and remix break down and
    become fluid. Doug Eyman suggests that we view these fluid boundaries in
    terms of circulation ecosystems that we find "in the use, remix, and
    appropriation of digital texts" (86). The challenge is making sense of
    these circulations. The videos in <em>Refiguring Citation</em> represent
    one way of exploring these shifting boundaries through the reflections of
    student composers. As Eyman reminds us, "The energy that drives this
    circulation comes from the rhetorical activity of digital bricoleurs" (86).
</p>
<p>
    The primary materials are student projects that turn video production on
    itself, capturing the screen to add a layer reflecting on poetry projects
    from an earlier assignment. At 03:58, an excerpt from a student citation
    video appears. On screen, a callout lists the source of an item used in the
student's video poem: "Simon Jardin. 'Flying like a bird.' https://vimeo.com/66284458." In
    the audio track from the citation video, the student narrator (Emily
    Shepherd) speaks: "This video was filmed in Australia, which is where I was
    born, so right off the bat I felt an emotional connection to this piece."
    Eyman says that when digitally mixing, we find "energy flows" (86). The
    audiovisual format of the reflection records these experiences
    and energies. Shepherd tells us that the drone clip "perfectly captured the
    sentiment I was going for, of feeling liberated, because of the gradual
    rise of the camera and how it looked down on the earth below," linking
    citation with motivations and feelings.

<aside class="pullquote-right">The one text is not an (inductive) access to a Model, but entrance into a
    network with a thousand entrances; to take this entrance is to aim,
    ultimately, not at a legal structure of norms and departures, a narrative
    or poetic Law, but at a perspective (of fragments, of voices from other
    texts, other codes), whose vanishing point is nonetheless ceaselessly
    pushed back, mysteriously opened: each (single) text is the very theory
    (and not the mere example) of this vanishing. <span

    Citation videos push past behaviors built on print. The expectations that
    govern the use of materials for print "we all take for granted," Lawrence
    Lessig explains. How they apply to media is an open question, with one
    possible response resulting in "the norms of 'quote freely, with
    attribution' spread from text to music and film" (55). Lessig offers a
    legal or ethical frame for extending use boundaries from print to media.
    This extension recasts something like "the right to quote" (55). Still,
    there are material differences between print and screen composing.
    Quotation behaviors, when translated to images and sound, become looping,
    layering, and remixing. These shifts and disruptions are not new. Gilles
    Deleuze traces similar changes to the integration of sound into cinema.
    Citing Jean-Luc Godard, he notes that adding sound does not create a new,
    separate layer to accompany images; rather, it alters the nature of images
    themselves as "mixing ousts montage, it being understood that mixing does
    not just consist of a distribution of the different sound elements, but the
    allocation of their differential relations with the visual elements" (175).
    Screen composing offers a merging that alters the meaning of materials. The
    norms for working with images, sounds, and words extend quotation and
    citation to something better understood in terms of transformation.
</p>
<p>
    Remixing in multimedia is complicated, because even images are themselves
    amalgams of visual, sonic, verbal, and time-based activity. This modality
    moves decision-making into boundary spaces. As Deleuze puts it, "the
    interaction of two images engenders or traces a frontier which belongs to
    neither one nor the other" (175). With screen composing, like the cinema
    Deleuze imagines, even a move as simple as integrating a clip into a video
    becomes layered and calls for recasting citation as a kind of tracing of
    movements among materials (both within and without the video).
</p>
<p>
    These movements present writers with questions of authority and ethics.
    Digital craft criticism, Adam Koehler suggests, requires imagining a new
    ethos that enables "authors to experiment with the different kinds of
    author/ity that emerge when hybridizing and modifying genres" (392). This
    ethos might deploy approaches that Deleuze links with cinema and that imply
    "a new conception of cutting, a whole 'pedagogy' which will operate in
    different ways" (22). A pedagogy for screen composing emerges through transformation and hybrid combinations where we find "questioning, responding,
    objecting, provoking, theorematizing, hypothesizing, experimenting" (22).
    In terms of rethinking citation practices, the student videos share some of
    the decision-making that emerges in these spaces.
