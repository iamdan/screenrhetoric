<p>This video was created for the 2016 Modern Language Convention, where it was presented with the narration performed as part of a panel on new practices for citation. It includes a number of student-created videos in which students reflect on their use of materials in multimedia projects. It also includes quotations from scholarly articles. It also includes materials from YouTube including captures of web screens and excerpts from a video on fair use practices.
</p>
<p>00:00 Video opens with a title on screen: (Re)Figuring Citation: Metaphors, Performance, and Transformative Use / Daniel Anderson iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan.
</p>
<p>00:05 A web page with an embedded video appears on screen. The narrator speaks: The video on screen captures YouTube’s content blocking system. I decided to include this because it happens all the time.
</p>
<p>00:15 A title appears on screen: First Metaphor: Private Property. The title fades out and the YouTube video re-appears. The play button is selected. A message appears: This video contains content from Warner Bros. Entertainment, who has blocked it on copyright grounds. The narrator continues:  We aim for fair use and it's frustrating when a video—one crafted to evoke a feeling or convey a message, one that makes transformative use of materials, one that represents a good deal of creative investment—is blocked algorithmically by YouTube.
</p>
<p>00:30 A web page appears on screen with an internet discussion posting remarking on the YouTube infringement algorithm. The narrator continues: The algorithm, it turns out, is very good at identifying the materials in in a video.
</p>
<p>00:40 A student video reflection appears on screen. It shows a video poem that features imagery of fishing and includes narration by the author: So that segment with the damselflies and the small blue wind olives, I thought that was a really, really good segment to put in because, you know, these bugs, on the river, these insects have such a finite life period. You know, they’re born in the water and they are literally swept up by the current. They spend their days free-falling down the river, with no control over their path.
</p>
<p>01:20 On screen a cursor has been typing in a Sticky Note window to compose a quotation: Writers commonly focused on . . . between 3 and 13 [criteria] when accounting for their citing decisions. . . . Different authors had different priorities, and one of the distinctions . . . was the authors’ identification with the ‘‘researcher’’ or ‘‘teacher’’ role. (Harwood 499) On screen, the student video reflection continues: And in a lot of ways, that’s kind of how we feel as humans. But something that this provides us, fishing provides us that feeling of stableness and control, and being at peace. And so these bugs, they get above water for a few days and they lay their eggs, and they come back down and they die. And it’s a short existence but they play this incredibly important role in the ecosystem of the river. And in that way, so do we as people.
</p>
<p>02:00 On screen a cursor has been typing on a translucent background to compose a quotation: Citation is a private and subjective process, and motivations/functions cannot straightforwardly be read off by the textual analyst, however specialized his/her knowledge.  (Harwood 497). A title appears on screen: Second Metaphor: Favorites. The narrator continues: The narration about the damselfly comes from Thompson Long. I picked that clip because the voice really pulled me in and it speaks to what Nigel Harwood identifies as decision-making criteria behind citation--like crediting, supporting, and engaging.
</p>
<p>02:23 On screen a new student video reflection is playing. It shows nature imagery that is part of a video poem and textual comments by the student that include the phrase, Here are some of my favorites!. The narrator continues: And Thompson's video extends these with a personal connection to fishing. Thompson is teaching as he discusses his video sources. The discussion of the sources creates a layer that operates on a meta level to those found in the composing space of the video editor, a layer to which has been applied an educational transformation. The YouTube algorithm—to my knowledge—doesn't check for that.
</p>
<p>02:49 On screen the student video reflection plays. The narrator continues: And why should it? That's something produced through exchange. Reading is nota disenchanted parsing of a fixed, original text. It's a prosumer process, where we copy to view and perform to read. And that's not to say the algorithm is unhelpful. In fact, it's the kind of thing that might transform the way we work with sources. We can filter, sort, list, even cite with the machine as we turn toward the thoughts and feelings associated with the materials. Why not a meta-container for personal meaning?
</p>
<p>03:24 On screen a new student video reflection appears. It shows a number of web screens and includes narration by the author: So I actually first heard this poem through a contest that my tenth grade class held. And the poem that won was I Wondered as Lonely as a Cloud. And I remember each day we heard the poem, it was recited by my good friend, Heather. This is Heather right here. And just the way she spoke, the way she portrayed this poem, if I were to imagine a daffodil as a person it would definitely be Heather.
</p>
<p>03:53 On screen a new student video reflection appears. It shows a video composing program and includes narration by the author: This video was filmed in Australia, which is where I was born, so right off the bat I felt an emotional connection to this piece. Throughout a lot of the video you can see the drone that’s carrying the camera so I had to find a segment that didn’t show the drone so that it would not interfere with the theme of birds and being free. Something about the drone being visible in the shot took away from the symbolic meaning of the poem. I also just couldn’t believe how high up the drone could fly and the beautiful sights it captured. I felt like this video perfectly captured the sentiment I was going for of feeling liberated, because of the gradual rise of the camera and how it looked down on the earth below. In this instance, I don’t feel like my use of the artist’s work devalued their's. Hopefully this is another case of enhancing the value of another artist’s work, and using the concept of intertextuality to create something new and beautiful.
</p>
<p>04:56 A white screen appears and cursor begins to type across the top. The narrator continues: The clips we just watched all required decisions about materials. I like that Kaitlyn "gave nods" to her favorite movies. And I chose that clip, because it uses text callouts to discuss its materials. The lack of sound in the clip allowed me to engage with Thompson's video and speaks to the challenges of managing attention. Too much typing and noise at the same time, and it's hard to focus.
</p>
<p>05:25 On screen the cursor has typed out a quotation: Digital craft criticism imagines what choices made at the material level contribute not only to the interpretation of the text that requires reading, watching and listening, but, more important, the limits and horizons that particular material conditions in digital environments make possible for imaginative texts. (Koehler 395)  The narrator continues: I like that Smriti chose her subject based on a happy memory of her good friend. And I like the way Emily points toward her personal connection with a video from Australia and guides us through the difficulties (and rewards) that came from working with the clip. And I like how Emily's discussion calls for new approaches when it comes to citation of time-based materials. Her discussion of the changing camera height and an emerging sense of liberty makes me wonder how to link such insights to a citational reference. And I wonder about the affordances of multimedia, as Emily unpacks the clip, bringing words back to the citational video even as they reveal the abstract and ambiguous richness and limitations of the moving visuals beneath.
</p>
<p>06:12 A title appears on screen: Third Metaphor: Listening. On screen a new student video reflection appears. It shows several web screens and includes narration by the author: I came across this and I said, you know, this is promising, make your own lanyard. And it wasn’t exactly what I wanted but it did have a song that I decided Ifell in love with.
</p>
<p>06:27 In the student video reflection the opening of the song, “Thieves and Kings” begins to play. The narration of the student author continues: So obviously this wasn’t a very good video PSA, but I loved the song. So I decided to rip this video and I used the song for my e-poem.
</p>
<p>06:48 On screen a cursor typing in callout box has composed a quotation: Advocating a context-is-the-new-content approach to the understanding of creative writing, Goldsmith proposes what he calls uncreative writing: “focused on . . . ‘manipulation’ and ‘management’ of the heaps of already existent and ever-increasing language. (Koehler 390) The callout fades out and a new student video reflection appears. It shows a YouTube-hosted video clip titled, Brian Eno – The Big Ship – DOTS extended edit and includes narration by the student author: So whenever I hear this piece of music I imagine all the millions of people in the world all kind of focused in on their own complicated lives but still somehow connected. I found this to be a really powerful feeling, but I wasn’t sure I would be able to find a poem that communicated the same ideas. So as silly as it sounds I ended up googling poetry about the vivid complexity of life and found exactly what I was looking for.
</p>
<p>07:20 A title appears on screen: Fourth Metaphor: Mixing. The title fades out and a cursor begins typing on screen. The narrator continues: I'd like to add a category to our citational metadata: suggested musical accompaniment. Those clips are just two of many discussing musical choices. And each reveals how an association adds nuance to a source. And we can make those associations on multiple levels—from the information-based, machine generated to the conceptual, human-created, from file names, time stamps, and edition numbers to whatever we might think to link up and assign—music, meanings, meanderings. On screen the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: When composers use multiple modes as tools for thinking rather than just to visually illustrate a completed script, they actually generate new meaning. Creation of a digital video then can become much more than an act of “translation” or transcription. . . . Compositing and new recursivity . . . are also critical cognitive experiences. . . . (Fulwiler and Middleton 44)
</p>
<p>08:04 A new student video reflection appears on screen. It shows imagery of clouds and includes narration by the student author: I searched high and low for the obvious footage: clouds. This is when I had a little breakthrough in regards to the meaning of the poem. It’s a very outside/in type of work, using the analogy of a fishing trip on the scale of the whole world. Sometimes you’re a fisherman; you’re in control and you see everything clearly. Other times, you’re the fish. I tried to incorporate this dual-nature into my e-poem, and I began by using a clip that makes the viewer seem powerful, as if the whole world is in his or her hands. This series of first clips open the video in a strong way, immediately alerting the viewer that there is something really weighty and significant discussed in this poem.
</p>
<p>08:40 A new student video reflection appears on screen. It shows a project in a video editor and includes narration by the student author: So the next stanza here begins with a change in speakers, so now the mirror is a lake, and I picked a droplet of water that I slowed down to be the background for these words, and, as the words “a woman bends over me” fade in--so does a clip of a woman who barely, slowly begins to open her eyes, and I scaled the clip of the woman and placed her so that the water droplet is right on her eye, and as it drops, her eye opens. So, um, let’s see--I can show right here as it hits, her eyes open up with the ripple.
</p>
<p>09:24 A new student video reflection appears. It shows a project in a video editor and includes narration by the student author. I added in this clip of the bird chirping. And then at the end I added the other clip of a bird chirping after the music had faded out. So it’s a completely different song. It’s not created by humans. The song that he is referring to, which is the bird.
</p>
<p>09:54 A title appears on screen: Last Metaphor: Resistance. A cursor appears on screen and begins typing. The narrator continues. These videos reveal the rich metadata that comes from capturing decision-making about sources. Amy shows how spending time with materials yields insights. Nicole links clips to composing decisions. Hannah points toward the relationship between humans and nonhumans. And all of the videos demonstrate the transformational possibilities of working with rich, mixings of materials. So what does this mean as we move citation into the digital age? On screen the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: Only the humanities and social science articles . . . contained reporting verbs characterizing the source as unreliable (e.g., fail, overlook, exaggerate, or ignore). This is attributed to the ‘‘more disputational style of argument’’ (p. 362) found in the soft knowledge fields. (Harwood 500)
</p>
<p>10:30 The quotation fades out and a cursor appears on screen and begins typing. The narrator continues: Citations have the potential for transforming or reinscribing values. Harwood found motivations for citations were more confrontational in the humanities. Fulwiler and Middleton note the hold that old logics have upon new media, recasting potential disruptions within linear paradigms. Intellectual cut-throating and values linked to fixed, linear logics. Pass. Perhaps if working with rich mixings of materials holds promise, reworking those workings with meta-level, process-oriented citations and responses can move us toward further transformations.
</p>
<p>11:09 On screen the cursor has completed typing out a quotation: The current model of digital video composing as a sequential series of temporally-discrete steps is predicated on the logic of old media and, thus, may no longer be sufficient to account for the new media composing processes that emerge with new media interfaces. (Fulwiler and Middleton 40). The quotation fades out and a new student video reflection appears on screen. It shows a project in a video editor and includes narration by the student author: I found this video on Vimeo and it’s from Matt Wood. And I found the visual aspect of this video to be extremely compelling because you get to see a bird flying in slow motion, which is not something you see everyday. It’s also interesting that the bird flies so close to the ground and seems to stay in place for a long time. This video made me think of Dickinson’s first stanza that describes a feeling of being trapped and almost passive. I did feel a sense of guilt in borrowing this cinematographer’s work without permission. The work is absolutely stunning, and I felt like not enough credit was given to him. However, I do not feel like my incorporation of his work devalues it, which is a principle of fair use. I also feel like incorporating his work enhanced the meaning of the Dickinson poem, which vibes with the concept of “intertextuality,” that all texts have a relationship to each other in some way.
</p>
<p>12:12 The student video reflection fades out and a cursor appears on screen and begins typing. The narrator continues: I put more of Emily's video in the presentation because she is thinking deeply about use decisions. So much of her commentary offers the rich, human-oriented meta-data that might build upon traditional or informational citation. In this way, the expansion and liberation she describes in her materials become a mode of resistance through creativity, through pushing writing in the digital age. To evaluate the power of such pushing, consider one final reference to YouTube: a video entitled YouTube copyright school. On screen the cursor has completed typing a quotation: Craft criticism . . . foregrounds textual production while backgrounding textual interpretation. . . . Craft criticism uses methods of production to examine the ways imaginative literature operates—and how it can help its authors and audience members engage critically with the cultural environment that surrounds them. (Koehler 381-382)
</p>
<p>12:48 On screen the quotation fades out and an excerpt from the video, YouTube Copyright School appears on screen the video contains animated characters and narration: Oh Russell, your use of Lumpy’s content is clever, but did you get permission for it? Mashups or remixes of content may also require permission from the original copyright owner, depending on whether or not the use is a fair use.
</p>
<p>13:02 On screen in the excerpt from the YouTube Copyright School Video, a bubble appears with a cursor typing. In the video clip, the tempo of the speech increases drastically as the narration continues: In the United States, copyright allows for the fair use of copyrighted material under certain limited circumstances without prior permission from the owner. Under the law, determinations of fair use take into account the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the work use in relation to the work as a whole, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work. Other jurisdictions may have similar copyright provisions protecting fair use or fair dealing. If you are uncertain as to whether a specific use qualifies as a fair use, you should consult a qualified copyright attorney.
</p>
<p>13:24 On screen, the excerpt from YouTube Copyright School fades out and a close up of a bird in flight from a student video project appears. The narrator speaks with an extremely fast pace: I decided to use the excerpt from YouTube copyright school. . . .
</p>
<p>13:28 The narrator continues at a normal pace: because it's so rich with irony. Listen to the clip and you hear an example of how not to use multimedia. Too much typing and noise, and it’s hard to focus. The pacing of the typed display, the pharmaceutical disclaimer voiceover, the banging and clanging all combine to say, pay no attention to the way you use the materials of others. In fact, don’t even try it. How to respond?
</p>
<p>13:59 On screen, a student video poem plays. It shows flocks of birds and single birds flying. The music in the video poem fades in. The singer sings: There was a dream and one day I could see it. Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it. And there was a kid with a head full of doubt. So I'll scream ‘til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out.
</p>
<p>14:24 The music fades out. On screen a list of works cited scrolls. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>The bulk of this video is made up of student projects. These videos use
screen recording to capture materials associated with class projects. They also
include reflections by the students on aspects of learning. These particular
videos focus on the use of materials in the student projects. They also contain
citations of the items that students have incorporated into their work. The
works that students reference are video poems composed for an undergraduate
course. In the class, students agree to post drafts and revisions of video
projects publicly. (Re)figuring Citation opens with an example of a video poem
that has had its content blocked by YouTube. A video produced by YouTube called
YouTube Copyright School is also excerpted at 12:48 in (Re)figuring
Citation.</p>

<p>The video also contains screen recordings of web sites. Some sites have been
integrated into (Re)figuring Citation--e.g., a discussion forum posting. Other
sites appear in the student-created videos as part of reflections on the use of
materials. Student videos also include materials captured from the web that are
integrated into student video poems. These materials are cited and acknowledge
in the reflection videos.</p>

<p>The video also includes images scanned from the MLA Handbook for Writers of
Research Papers. The images were scanned with permission from a pre-publication
draft of the book. At 01:22 in the video, a scanned image from the book shows a
series of questions meant to guide students through flexible engagements with
citation: Who is the author of the source? What is the title of the source? How
was the source published? Where did you find the source? When was the source
published? At 01:30, a final question is added: Why did you decide to use the
source? At 5:36 in the video, a scanned page from the book appears with a
passage that offers the metaphor of a container for understanding citation
formats.</p>

<p>Key elements of the video are textual callouts or on screen typing with
quotations from articles related to citation. Excerpts point to decision making
and thinking associated with citation practices. Quotations also take up shifts
in thinking and practices around digital composing. These are cited on screen in the video.</p>





</div>



<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> Students patchwrite because they are engaging
shallowly with their sources, usually working only with sentences gleaned from
the first pages of the source. In a sense, they don't understand any of their
sources. How could they, when they're not actually reading them? And when they
don't understand--when they are merely quote-mining their sources--they
patchwrite. (75) </aside>

<p>Citation creates a continuum when it comes to the way we weave materials into
projects. On one end, citations are evidential markers and links to
sources--works cited. On another end, they are the stuff of thought, as composers
bring together materials and mix them into projects. And this continuum is
multi-channel, with legal, ethical, compositional, cultural concerns--ranges and
questions--layered over one another as we work with sources. Screen composing
adds more layers, for audiovisuals, for motion, for genres, for creative production.  </p>

<p>Citation reveals how screen composing extends from and pushes against
behaviors built on print mind sets. The norms that govern the use of materials
for print, "we all take for granted," Lawrence Lessig, explains. How those norms
apply to media is an open question, with one possible response resulting in "the
norms of 'quote freely, with attribution' spread from text to music and film"
(55). Lessig offers a legal or ethical frame for tracing the use-boundaries
between print and media. A practice like remix recasts acceptable uses like "the
right to quote" (55). Behaviors based on print meet in screen composing an
active testing new modes of thinking and writing that use borrowing, loops,
remix to bring together images, sounds and words. Print protocols and logics
warn of the surface-level attention linked with quickly mixed citations. Screen
composing responds by making quick mixing a fundamental inventive move.</p>



<p> The response offered by screen composing extends the patching together of
materials to inlcude images, words, and sounds. These kinds of shifts and their
associated disruptions are not new. Giles Deleuze traces similar disruptions tied to
the integratrion of sound into cinema. Citing Godard, he notes that adding sound
does not create a new, separate layer to accompany image; rather it alters the
nature of images themselves as "mxing ousts montage, it being understood that
mixing does not just consist of a distribution of the different sound elements,
but the allocation of their differential relations with the visual elements"
(175).</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">When digital writing practices ask (and often
require) authors to experiment with the different kinds of author/ity that
emerge when hybridizing and modifying genres, then an attendant ethos also needs
to emerge. As such, the authorship category of digital craft criticism begins
the project of (re) imagining the ethos imaginative writers occupy when
appropriating, employing, or modifying language, ready-made texts, and/or
particular genres. -- Digital Craft 392  </aside>

<p>Remixing in multimedia is complicated because not only are images themselves
amalgams of visual, sonic, verbal, and time-based activity, they also must be
understood in terms of the interstices between the items. "It is not a matter of
following a chain of images, even across voids, but of getting out of the chain
or the association" (174). In terms of decision making related to materials,
this cinematic modality calls for weighing the ways items extend and
complicate one another, or more precisely, create boundary spaces where this
shaping plays out. As Deleuze puts it, "the interaction of two images engenders
or traces a frontier which belongs to neither one nor the other" (175). With screen composing, like the cinema Deleuze imagines, even a citation as
simple as integrating a snippet of sound into a video becomes layered and mixed
with boundaries as a circuit of movement among materials emerges in "a network
of sound communication and permutation, bearing noises, sounds, reflexive or
interactive speech-acts and music" (228). </p>

<p>Digital craft criticism, Adam Koehler suggests, requires imagining a new
ethos from which authors might experiment with such emerging modes. This ethos
might deploy the kinds of approaches that Deleuze links with "cinema [that] is
going to become an analytic of the image, implying a new conception of cutting,
a whole 'pedagogy' which will operate in different ways" (22) Koehler's craft
criticism "foregrounds textual production while backgrounding textual
interpretation" (381). This production calls for thinking not only about but
also through the the mediated materials of composing. The screen itself calls
for the "camera-consciousness" that, Delueze suggests, "would no longer be
defined by the movements [the camera] is able to follow or make, but by the
mental connections it is able to enter into" (22). This consciousness emerges in
the spaces of conjunction, the interstices where we find "questioning,
responding, objecting, provoking, theorematizing, hypothesizing, experimenting"
(22). How do these engagements relate to the mixing of materials into media
projects? In terms of citation practices, the student reflective videos in
(Re)figuring Citation perhaps offer examples of composers documenting the
material decision making associated associated with these frontier spaces of
screen composing.
