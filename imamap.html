<button class="accordion">Transcript</button> <div class="panel"> <p>


  <p>This video was composed using video capturing and editing
software. It utilizes web materials, including articles and imagery. It also
includes clips of several videos from Apple Computer's “Get a Mac” advertising campaign. The
video also contains scans from books and articles as well as imagery from image
and audio editing programs.</p>

  <p>00:00 The video opens with a black screen; the rhythm of a shaker marking
  time is audible. The sound of thunder can be heard. An image of a decaying
  leaf, in black and white, appears on screen. The sound of bubbles underwater
  can be heard. On screen, the image zooms out to reveal the leaf image hosted
  on the web site, Flickr. The cursor selects a thumbnail icon, and an image of
  multicolored wires appears. A title appears on screen: “I'm a Map I'm a Green
  Tree.” </p>

  <p>00:40 On screen, the term “network” is typed into Flickr’s search field.
  The narrator begins: “I'm here and I'm talking about how people, ideas, and
  things fit together. How we represent culture with  maps or ecologies. How we
  render something like Flickr: people, gathered in groups, a network of
  connections." </p>

  <p>01:02 On screen, the network image is replaced with the decaying leaf,
  which is sometimes resized to fill the screen. The narrator continues: “Or, we
  look to the living world for models. Of this image we're told ‘microbes in the
  soil consume the leaf's soft tissue and leave only the cellulose and lignin
  skeleton.’ The Flickr image suggests space, the leaf says time, the slow decay
  paradoxically revealing connections. It's these connections we're about to
  explore.” </p>

  <p>01:30 On screen, the window holding the leaf dissolves into a search field
  containing the phrase “language paradox.” The cursor selects a link from the
  results, and a page from a book appears on screen: page three from <em>The Well
  Wrought Urn</em>, by Cleanth Brooks. The narrator continues: “Let's start . . . with
  language. I'm here and I'm talking about flow zones, those spaces where
  transformation happens, the in-betweens where we find the breathing current.”
  </p>

  <p>01:47 The sound of electric current can be heard.  A passage from <em>The Well
  Wrought Urn</em>
  is highlighted: “of paradox; apparently the truth which the poet utters can be
  approached only in terms of paradox.” The narrator continues: “This is old
  style, the focus zoomed smack-dab to the printed word. ‘The truth which the
  poet utters can be approached only in terms of paradox.’ We bring new focus
  now, but wow, that's some hard commitment to the power of the written, or here
  the spoken, word.” </p>

  <p>02:11 The cursor scrolls through the book. The screen zooms into a new page
  and a passage is highlighted: “[The poet must] work by analogies, metaphors do
  not lie in the same plane or fit neatly edge to edge. There is a continual
  tilting of the planes; necessary overlappings, discrepancies, contradictions.”
  The narrator continues: “Metaphors do not lie in the same plane or fit neatly
  edge to edge. There is a continual tilting . . . necessary overlappings,
  discrepancies, contradictions.” </p>

  <p>02:24 The screen zooms in on the passage and a word is highlighted:
  “contradictions.” The sound of thunder cracks. The narrator continues: “The
  edges of paradox emerge with words,  arrayed and linked to new ideas. Like how
  the tenor of the metaphor makes way for its vehicle.” </p>

  <p>02:39 The Wikipedia entry for “metaphor” fills the screen, and a passage is
  copied, and then pasted into a text editor: “[metaphor] is in two parts: the tenor
  and the vehicle. The tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed.
  The vehicle is the subject whose attributes are borrowed. Other writers employ
  the general terms ground and figure to denote tenor and the vehicle. Consider
  the All the world's a stage [monologue from As You Like It.]” The narrator
  continues: “Words cross the connotational space, where one idea flows into
  another, where meaning develops. In poetry we call for vehicles, red
  wheelbarrows from which we borrow attributes, modes of transport that bring
  the associations of one element into circuit . . . with another.” </p>

  <p>03:05 The sound of a jet flying past are heard. A web page hosted by Apple.com appears on
  screen, with the page heading: “Get a Mac - Watch the TV Ads.” A video,
  titled “Trust Mac,” begins to play. The video shows two figures against a white
  background. The figure on the right in a blue shirt says, "hello, I'm a Mac."
  The figure on the left in a trenchcoat says, "And I am no one." The video’s
  audio is lowered and  the narrator continues: “I'm a mac I'm a pc. This
  commingling of human and machine reveals the back and forth coursing of
  attributes. Virus. Spyware. Glasses. Cool shirt. The machine and human
  co-informing each other.”</p> </p>

  <p>03:35 The volume in the video returns  and the figure in the trenchcoat
  says, "You never saw me." The figure in the blue shirts responds, "never saw
  who,” and winks. The figure in the trench coat says, "Me, PC." </p>

  <p>03:43 A scanner software window slowly loads a scanned image from a book. A
  callout with citation information appears: “Latour, Bruno. <em>Reassembling the
  Social</em>. Oxford University Press, 2005. The scanned page is enlarged and a
  passage highlighted: “To make it fit our purposes we have to add a fourth
  feature that, I agree, breaks down the orginal metaphor somewhat: a network is
  not made of nylon thread, words or any durable substance but is the trace left
  behind by some moving agent. It has to be traced anew by the passage of
  another vehicle, another circulating entity.” The narrator continues: “The Mac
  or PC metaphors show how people, ideas, and things flow together in cultural
  networks. The currents circulate, back and forth. A network . . . it's the
  trace left behind by some moving agent. It has to be traced anew by the
  passage of another vehicle, another circulating entity. The red wheelbarrow
  depends upon the bicycle and the bus driver being on time.” </p>

  <p>04:15 On screen, an image showing brightly colored pencils hosted on Flickr is selected and enlarged. The
  narrator continues: “Moving entities, tracing and circulating. ‘Fantastic
  detail,’ ‘Wow . . . Texture.’ ‘Amazing focus.’ ‘My favorite color.’
  Relationships growing within flowing networks of red, umber, pencil. Power
  Cords. Power chords.” </p>

  <p>04:40 The sound of a passing jet can be heard. On screen, the Apple commercial,
  titled “Accident,” fills the screen. In the video, a figure on the right says,
  "Hello, I'm a Mac." A figure on the left in a brown suit seated in a
  wheelchair and wearing casts on both arms and one leg says, "And I'm a PC."
  The Mac character says, "I'm afraid to ask." The PC character replies, "Well,
  I was sitting at my desk. Someone walked by, carelessly tripped over my power
  cord, yanked me straight down to the ground, bam." The Mac character responds,
  "Yikes. Macbooks come with this power cord that connects magnetically, so,
  when it gets pulled it just pops right off. Everything is just kind of thought
  out, you know like the tiny built in iSight camera, or. . . ." The PC character
  responds, "My life is flashing before my eyes. I see a sunset in a field of
  beautiful wheat." The Mac character responds, "Isn't that your screensaver?"
  The PC character responds, "Yeah." </p>

  <p>05:12 The screen dissolves into an  e-mail thread responding  to the query:
  "If either Mac or PC were setting up a Pandora radio station, what song or
  artist would they use to get started?" The cursor copies and pastes responses
  into a text editor, then into an image editor. Text and icons are manipulated
  in the image editor. The narrator continues: “What follows is we find
  ourselves awash amid entities that give and take shape among one another: The
  Shins, Kelly Clarkson, Mac Mail, Mastodon, Webmail, copy, paste, copy, paste,
  power cords, empathy, celebrity, sharing, IP, music, text, text editor,
  Justin, John, Hannah, Lady Gaga, cheesy, ukulele, sun, dust, rolling thunder,
  clouds crowding . . . circulating collections of people, ideas, and things.”
  </p>

  <p>06:04 On screen a scanning software window appears, scanning a page from a
  book. A passage is highlighted: [Subjects are no more] autochthonous than
  face-to-face interactions. They, too, depend on a flood of entities to exist.
  To be an 'actor' is now at last a fully artificial and fully traceable
  gathering.” The narrator continues: “[We] depend on a flood . . . of entities
  to exist. To be an actor is now at last a fully artificial and fully
  traceable . . . gathering.” </p>

  <p>06:17 A video fills the screen. Against a white background, three figures
  stand. On the right is a figure in a light blue shirt. On the left is a figure
  in a brown suit. Behind these is a figure in a dark suit with dark glasses.
  The figure on the right says, "Hello, I'm a Mac." The figure in the back says,
  "Mac has issued a salutation, cancel or allow?" The figure in the brown suits,
  responds, "Allow. And I'm a PC." The figure in the back says, "You are
  returning Mac's salutation, cancel or allow?" The PC character says, "Allow."
  The Mac character asks, "Okay, what gives?" The figure in the back says, "Mac
  is asking a question, cancel or allow?" The PC character responds, "Allow.
  He's part of Vista, my new operating system. PCs have a lot of security
  problems, so he asks me to authorize pretty much anything I do." </p>

  <p>06:36 The audio on the video is lowered. The narrator continues: "The concern
  is that these entities constrain us, shape us, and tell us who we are.” </p>

  <p>06:43 The volume on the video is restored and the figure in the back of the video says,
  "You are coming to a sad realization, cancel or allow?" The PC character says,
  "Allow." </p>

  <p>06:48 On screen, a new video from the "Get a Mac" campaign appears. On the
  right is a figure in a light blue shirt. On the left is a figure in a brown
  shirt. As the video plays, a block of text in small font appears, slowly
  covering the two characters. The narrator continues: “The gatherings threaten
  the human figure by binding us together, surrounding us with ideas and
  things.” </p>

  <p>06:58 On screen, the blocks of small text continue to cover the figures. The
  Mac character says, "Did your legal copy just grow?" The PC character
  responds, "Yeah, you see usually PCs require a lot of regular maintenance,
  downloading security patches, virus scans. I can't just go out there and say,
  'hey, getting started on PC is the easiest thing in the world.'" The Mac
  character says, “Whoa. That's a lot of legal copy.” The PC character says,
  "Watch this. PCs are now 100% trouble free." A large block of small text
  completely covers both characters. The Mac character says, "Look at that." The
  PC character responds, "That's a lot of legal copy." </p>

  <p>07:19 The scanning window reappears. A scan from a book is manipulated in
  an image editor. The narrator continues: “But there is also an organic flow,
  as we gather together in circuit with machines. An entity among entities,
  conduit for streams of meaning-making and performing action, never powerless,
  full of awareness of layerings, knowing that categories (like worlds) can
  still bring us transformation.” </p>

  <p>07:45 On screen, the Pandora web site appears, and “shins” is typed into a search field. The
  narrator continues: “I'm here and I'm talking about fitting in. PC goes to
  Pandora and types in Shins. The machine responds. The composition is one of
  mixing, but the zoom is way out. Choosing word over image or sound feels
  myopic. The composing here is one of entity in flowing network, not type cast,
  but acting.” </p>

  <p>08:10 On screen, the image editor reappears. The cursor manipulates a
  scanned page from a book.The narrator continues: “I'm talking about
  performing. The way the network is never hung up to dry, but always in motion,
  always calling us to be . . . composing. What is a text? What isn't? What is
  writing? The paintbrush. The poet. The CPU. The lungs. The organic mechanic
  typing song as worlds unfold in a streaming cast. Fantastic detail. What focus
  did you use? My favorite color. . . .” </p>

  <p>08:50 The scanning window reappears, and then a scan from a book is opened in an image editor. A passage is highlighted:
  “rather, the circulation of quasi-standards allow anonymous and isolated
  agencies to slowly become, layer after layer, comparable and
  commensurable--which is surely a large part of what we mean by being human.
  This common measurement depends, of course, on the quality of what is
  transferred. The question is not to fight against categories but rather to
  ask: 'Is the category subjecting or subjectifyingyou?' As we saw at the end of
  the last chapter, freedom is getting out of a bad bondage, not the absence of
  bonds. The narrator continues: "Through circulation . . . we become,
  layer after layer, comparable and commensurable. . . . Human. The question is
  not to fight against categories but rather to ask: 'Is the category subjecting
  or subjectifying you . . . freedom is getting out of a bad bondage, not an
  absence of bonds.’ All the world's a studio, and we are but performers and
  mechanics, transporting meanings through each lignin layer.” </p>

  <p>09:25 On screen, the GarageBand audio editor appears. The playhead scrolls over several
  channels as the background sound track plays. The narrator continues: “I'm
  here and I'm talking about the connotational flow, the liquid mixings of sound
  and light, felt-like, felt like the composing of self with . . . words. </p>

  <p>09.40 The sound of thunder is heard. The narrator concludes: “I’m a map.
  I’m a green tree.” </p>

  <p>09:57 The cursor presses stop on the audio editor. The music stops. The video ends.

  <p>The video contains screen captures of materials gathered from the web, including imagery of
  a decaying leaf, a strand of wires, a network visualization, and
  colored pencils. Web searches and pages from Google
  books, Wikipedia, and Pandora are also captured. </p>

  <p><em>I'm a Map</em> also includes materials from videos taken from Apple Computer's "Get
  a Mac" advertising campaign. These make up the core of the intellectual argument
  of the piece. The suggestion is that metaphors have become actualized as
  characters, embodying posthuman blurrings of people and
  machines. </p>

  <p>The video also includes e-mail messages and a number of traditional
  quotations. A screen capture of e-mail software shows items in an e-mail
  conversation thread on a public mailing list. Quotations are captured using images that have been scanned from
  books or journals. The video also includes original materials by the author. An image editor
  file is manipulated to deliver text and icons. And a soundtrack has been
  composed using audio editing software.</p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>




<aside class="pullquote-right">Cinema does not have metaphor's specific power of
giving a "subject" the verb or action of another subject; it has to juxtapose
the two subjects, and so make the metaphor subject to a metonymy. <span
class="attribution">Gilles Deleuze, <strong>Cinema 2</strong> (155)</span>
</aside>

<p>This video was published in 2010 in <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric,
Technology, and Pedagogy</em>. A version of the piece was performed at the
Conference on College Composition and Communication in the spring of that year.
The piece brings together several segments of captured performances with web
sites and software. The imagery highlights passages from books as a way of
integrating scholarly citations into the video. Narration by the author
discusses materials, tracing connections between humans and machines. </p>


<p><em>I'm a Map</em> extends the proposition that "the formation of metaphors is the
fundamental human drive" (Philosophy and Truth 88) into the screen world through
Apple Computer's "Get a Mac" advertising campaign. The ads represent the ways
that attributes attach to entities or actors. Here the actors are actualized in the dweeby PC and the hip Mac characters.
Rendering concepts through metaphor shifts as representation moves from words to
audiovisual media. As Gilles Delueze explains, "cinema cannot say with the poet:
'hands flutter'; it must first show hands being moved about quickly and then
leaves fluttering" (155). The characters in <em>I'm a Map</em>, however, move in ways words cannot.
Discussing legal copy, power cords, and security protocols, Justin and John, Mac
and PC, take shape. Clearly, metaphor has entered a new space.</p>

<p> Posthuman perspectives reveal more about these transformations. In the audio
track of the piece, bubbles underwater can be heard regularly. This bubbling
evokes the channels "through which masses of entities begin to circulate"
(<em>Reassembling the Social</em>  196). When connecting things, what matters are "the
vehicles, the movements, the shifts, and the translation <em>between</em> loci
rather than the loci themselves" (196). Bruno Latour notes how communication
over time emerges "circulating through channels most easily materialized by
techniques--paper techniques and, more generally, intellectual technologies
being as important as gears, levers, and chemical bonds" (196). Latour starts with
paper techniques as channels for circulating entities that move ideas. The
sounds of bubbles in water evoke similar circulations through audiovisual channels.</p>

<p>In many ways, the
soundtrack is the most unconventional scholarly aspect of <em>I'm a Map</em>. The looped baseline
and shaker sounds evoke spoken word expectations. The sounds of thunder and water mix
with those of circuitry. Nietzsche says we seek metaphors "to refashion the
world," to make it "colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence,
charming, and eternally new" (89).

Metaphors work to capture concepts, Nietzsche tells us, but always become
"regular and rigid" until their power slips away. In response (or in circuit),
the intellect enchants, and rhapsodists act, until fixed concepts are "torn by
art" (89) that once again "throws metaphors into confusion and displaces the boundary
stones of abstractions" (90). For Latour, the shifting circulations make it so
that a network is a tracing of activity, and that writing itself is renewed as
the entities under consideration "are treated not as intermediaries but as
mediators" (<em>Reassembling the Social</em> 128). Even boundaries are caught up as the
whole network is put into motion and entities shape-shift among one another.
Composing works in similar ways, as does <em>I'm a Map</em>, where shifting boundaries
evoke characters that blend humans and machines.

<aside class="pullquote-left"> If we have been able to show that glorified sites
like global or local were made out of circulating entities, why not postulate
that subjectivities, justifications, unconscious, and personalities would
<em>circulate</em> as well? <span class="attribution">Bruno Latour, <strong>Reassembling the Social</strong> (207)</span></aside>






<p>Erin Manning sees these circulations as "movement that foregrounds incipience
rather than displacement" (5). Following Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guittari, as
well as Alfred North Whitehead, she explains that "events <em>create</em> time
and space" (7). Here, this movement is linked with composing through "the
pulling out of expression from the durational plane of experience" (7). Manning
offers dancing as an art linked with experiences of movement.
And she questions digital experiences where "you know in advance what could
happen" (65). Instead, we should "foreground the effects of unknowability that
are present in every movement" (65). Manning cites Henri Bergson, suggesting
"that movement need not be thought [of] . . . as a quantitative displacement from a to
b" (6). Instead, a focus on the "the immanence of movement moving," on the
possibilities of <em>a</em> before the closure of <em>b</em>, "opens up experience to the
unknowable" (7). </p>

<p>Technical systems, Manning worries, might limit unknowability. Taking
up the combination of technology and dance, she suggests that "the 'emergent' quality of the system depends on how
a body moves with the software" (65). Movements should emerge with--rather than
be predetermined by--software. Video scholarship  foregrounds the ways software
and composers co-determine experiences. When in circuit, agency flows as
composing plays out through movements that have  unknowability, through what Manning
calls "[moving] toward relational eventfulness." In co-emergent fashion, humans
and machines can work against the grain of software. "For this to take place,
recompositions of potential (movement taking-form through virtual recombinations
shape-shifting into displacements) are necessary" (65). These shape shiftings
activate multiple recombinations that develop "in tandem with the co-composition
of an event in the making" (65).

 </p>

<p>Deleuze notes that cinema can't mix concepts like "hands flutter" as easily
as words can, but adds that cinema can achieve metaphor through "the harmonics
of the image" (155). Not only can images have their distinct harmonics, they
resonate with both authors and viewers who "integrate thought into the image"
(156). This process, Deleuze (following Sergei Eisenstein) notes, creates "a circuit
which includes simultaneously the author, the film and the viewer" (156) In this
circuit, we find "action-thought," sublime movements that "metaphoric composition expresses" (157).  In the disruption of boundaries,
Nietzsche calls for "the intellect [to throw] the token of bondage from itself"
(90).  In writing about the social, Latour builds the network, puts it in
motion, then looks for levers and clamps. In eventful experiences, Manning
offers dancing. So many metaphors deployed to disrupt (or remake) boundaries. In screen
composing, PC goes to Pandora and types in Shins.</p>
