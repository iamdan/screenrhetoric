<p>This video was composed in March of 2011 using Camtasia video capture and
editing software. It displays web materials including articles and imagery. It
also includes clips of several videos from Apple Computer's I'm a Mac campaign.
The video also contains scans from books and articles as well as imagery from
image and audio editing programs.</p>

<p>00:00 The video opens with a black screen and the soundtrack begins playing.
The sound of thunder can be heard. An image of a decaying leaf appears on
screen. The sound of bubbles underwater can be heard. On screen, the image zooms
out to reveal the leaf image hosted on the web site, Flickr. The selects a
thumbnail icon, and an image of multicolored wires appears. A title appears on
screen: I'm a Map I'm a Green Tree.</p>

<p>00:40 On screen, the cursor types in a search field, loading an image of a
network. The narrator begins: I'm here and I'm talking about how people, ideas,
and things fit together. How we render knowledge through maps, schematics. How
we render something like flickr: people, gathered in groups, a network of
connections.
</p>
<p>01:02 On screen, the network image is replaced with the decaying leaf. The
narrator continues: Or we model thought with ecologies. Of this image we're told
"microbes in the soil consume the leaf's soft tissue and leave only the
celullose and lignin skeleton." The flickr image suggests space, the leaf says
time, the slow decay, paradoxically, revealing connections. It's these connections we're about to explore.
</p>
<p>01:30 On screen, a web browser window appears and the cursor types in the search
field at the top: languge paradox. The cursor selects a link from the results
and a page from a book appears on screen: page three from The Well Wrought Urn
by Cleanth Brooks. The narrator continues: Let's start . . . with language. I'm
here and I'm talking about flowzones, those spaces where transformation happens,
the in-betweens where we find . . . the breathing current.
</p>
<p>01:47 The sound of electronic current can be heard. On screen the page from the
book is zoomed in and a passage is highlighted: of paradox; apparently the truth
which the poet utters can be approached only in terms of paradox. I overstate
the case, to be sure; it is possible that the title. The narrator continues: This is old style the focus zoomed smack dab to the printed word.
"the truth which the poet utters can be approached only in terms of paradox."
We bring new focus now, but wow that's some hard commitment to the power of the written
or here the spoken . . . word
</p>
<p>02:11 The cursor scrolls through the book. The screen zooms into a new page and
passage is highlighted: [The poet must] work by analogies, metaphors do not lie
in the same plane or fit neatly edge to edge. There is a continual tilting of
the planes; necessary overlappings, discrepancies contradictions. The narrator
continues: metaphors do not lie in the same plane or fit neatly edge to edge.
There is a continual tilting . . . necessary overlappings, discrepancies,
contradictions.
</p>
<p>02:24 The screen zooms in on the passage and a word is highlighted:
contradictions. The sound of thunder can be heard. The narrator continues: The
edges yield the words, arrayed and linked with new ideas. Like how the tenor of
the metaphor makes way for its vehicle.
</p>
<p>02:39 A page for the entry, metaphor, wikipedia is brought on screen and a
passage is selected, copied, then pasted into a text editor window. An excerpt
is highlighted: [metaphor] is in two parts: the tenor and the vehicle. The tenor
is the subject to which attributes are ascribed. The vehicle is the subjet whose
attributes are borrowed. Other writers employ the general terms ground and
figure to denote tenor and the vehicle. Consider the All the world's a stage
[monologue from As You Like It.] The narrator continues: It is the connotational
space, where one idea flows into another, where meaning develops. In poetry we
call for vehicles, red wheelbarrows from which we borrow attributes, modes of
transport that bring the associations of one element into circuit . . . with
another.
</p>
<p>03:05 The sound of a jet flying past are heard. On screen, a web page
appears. At the top is the title: Get a Mac - Watch the TV Ads. The cursor
clicks on a thumbnail with the text, Trust Mac, and a video appears on screen.
The video shows two figures against a white background. The figure on the right
in a blue shirt says, "hello, I'm a Mac." The figure on the levt in a trenchcoat
says, "And I am no one." The audio in Trust Mac video is turned down and the
narrator continues: I'm a mac I'm a pc. This commingling of human and machine
reveals the back and forth coursing of attributes. Virus. Spyware. Glasses. Cool
shirt. The machine and the human co-informing each other.</p>
</p>
<p>03:35 The volume on the Trust Mac commercial is turned up and the figure in the
trenchcoat says, "You never saw me." The figure in the blue shirts responds,
"never saw who?" The figure in the trenchoat says, "Me, PC."
</p>
<p>03:43 On a scanner software window appears and fills slowly with an scanned
image from a page in a book. A callout with citation information appears:
Latour, Bruno. (2005) Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network
theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The page from the book is zoomed in and
a passage highighted: To make it fit our purposes we have to add a fourth
feature that, I agree, breaks down the orginal metaphor somewhat: a network is
not made of nylon thread, words or any durable substance but is the trace left
behind by some moving agent. It has to be traced anew by the passage of another
vehicle, another circulation entity. The narrator continues: The back and forth
shows how cultural networks flow with organic growth and decay. Always there is
change. A network . . . its the trace left behind by some moving agent. It has
to be traced anew by the passage of another vehicle, another circulating entity.
The red wheelbarrow depends upon the bicylye and the bus driver being on time.
</p>
<p>04:15 On screen, search results from the Flickr web site appear and a cursor
clicks on a thumbnail. An image showing the tips of multi-colored pencils
appears. The narrator continues: Moving entities tracing and circulating.
Fantastic detail, Wow . . . Texture. Amazing focus. My favorite color.
Relationships growing within flowing networks of red, umber, pencil. Powercords.
Power chords.
</p>
<p>04:40 The sound of a passing jet can be heard. On screen the Get a Mac - Watch
the TV Ads page appears, the cursor clicks a thumbnail titled, Accident, and a
video fills the screen. In the video, a figure on the right says, "Hello, I'm a
mac." A figure on the left in a brown suit seated in a wheelchair and wearing
casted on both arms and one leg says, "And I'm a PC" The Mac character says,
"I'm afraid to ask." The PC character replies, "Well, I was sitting at my desk.
Someone walked by, carelessly tripped over my powercord, yanked me straight down
to the ground, bam." The Mac character responds, "Yikes. Macbooks come with this
powercord that connects magnetically, so, when it gets pulled it just pops right
off and everything is just kind of thought out, you know like the tiny built in
iSight camera." The PC character responds, "My life is flashing before my eyes.
I see a sunset in a field of beautiful wheat." The Mac character reponds, "Isn't
that your screen saver?" The PC character responds, "Yeah."
</p>
<p>05:12 On screen an e-mail message thread appears with responses to the query:
"If either Mac or PC were setting up a pandora radio station, what song or
artist would they use to get started?" The cursor copies and pastes responses
into a text editor. The curser copies and pasted collected responses into an
image editor. The cursor manipulates text and icons in the image editor. The
narrator continues: What follows is we find ourselves awash amid entities that
give and take shape among one another. The Shins. Kelly Clarkson. Mac mail.
Mastodon, Web mail, copy, paste, copy, paste, powercords, empathy, celebrity,
sharing, IP, music, text, text editor, text wrangler, Justin, John, Hannah, Lady
Gaga, cheesy, ukulele, sun dust rolling thunder clouds crowding . . .
circulating collections of people, ideas, and things.
</p>
<p>06:04 On screen a scanning software window appears and a page from a book is
scanned. A passage is highlighted: Subjects are no more autochthonous than
face-to-face interactions. They, too, depend on a flood of entities to exist. To
be an 'actor' is now at last a fully artificial and fully traceable gathering.
The narrator continues: [We] depend on a flood . . . of entities to exist. To be
an actor is now at last a fully artificial and fully traceable gathering.
</p>
<p>06:17 A video fills the screen. Against a white backgrount, three figures stand.
On the right is a figure in a light blue shirt. On the left is a figure in a
brown suit. Behind these, is a figure in a dark suit with dark glasses. The
figure on the right says, "Hello, I'm a Mac." The figure in the back says, "Mac
has issues a salutation, cancel or allow?" The figure in the brown suits,
responds, "Allow. And I'm a PC." The figure in the back says, "You are returning
Mac's salutation, cancel or allow?" The PC character says, "Allow." The Mac
character asks, "Okay, what gives?" The figure in the back says, "Mac is asking
a question, cancel or allow?" The PC character responds, "Allow. He's part of Vista my new operations system. PCs have a lot of security problems, so he asks me to authorize pretty much anything I do."
</p>
<p>06:36 The audio on the Get a Mac video is turned down and the narrator
continues: The concern is that these entities constrain, shape us and set us in
bonds.
</p>
<p>06:43 The audio is turned up on the Get a Mac video and the figure in the back says, "You are coming to a sad realization, cancel or allow?" The PC character says, "Allow."
</p>
<p>06:48 On screen a new video from the Get a Mac campaing appears. On the right is
a figure in  a light blue shirt. On the left is a figure in a brown shirt. As
the video plays, block of text in small font appear, slowly covering the two
characters. The narrator continues: THe gatherings threaten the human figure by
binding us together, surrounding us with ideas and things.
</p>
<p>06:58 On screen the blocks of small text continue to cover the figures. The Mac
character says, "Did your legal copy just grow?" The PC character responds,
"Yeah, you see usually PCs require a lot of regular maintenance, downloading
securiting patches, virus scans. I can't just go out there and say, 'hey,
getting started on PC is the easiest thing in the world.'"
</p>
<p>07:09 On screen the blocks of small text continue to cover the figures. The Mac
character says, Whoa. That's a lot of legal copy. The PC character says, "Watch
this. PCs are now 100% trouble free." A large block of small text completely
covers both characters. The Mac character says, "Look at that." The PC character
responds, "That's a lot of legal copy."
</p>
<p>07:19 On sreen a scanning window appears and a page from a book is
scanned. The image from the book is manipulated in an image editor The narrator continues: But entities are also co-emergent, with things
like texts forming and performing in circuit with ideas and people. We enjoy the
shape-making as we gather together with things and ideas. An entity among
entities, conduit for streams of meaning-making and performing action, never
powerless, full of awareness of layerings, knowing that categories (like worlds)
can still bring us transformation.
</p>
<p>07:45 On screen, the Pandora Internet Radio web site appears. A cursor appears
in a search field and types Shins. The narrator continues: I'm here and I'm
talking about fitting in. PC goes to Pandora and types in Shins. The machine
responds. The composition is one of mixing, but the zoom is way out. Choosing
word over image or sound feels myopic. The composing here is one of entity in
flowing network, not type cast but acting.
</p>
<p>08:10 On screen an image editor appears. The cursor opens a file containing a
scanned image from a book. The image of the book page is manipulated in the
image editor. The narrator continues: I'm talking about performing. The way the
network is never hung up to dry but always in motion, always calling us to be . . .
composing. What is a text? What isn't? What is writing? The paintbrush. The
poet. The CPU. The lungs. The organic mechanic typing song as worlds unfold in
the streaming cast. Fantastic detail. What focus did you use? My favorite color. . . .
</p>
<p>08:50 On screen a scanning window appears. A page from a book is scanned and a
passage highlighted: rather, the circulation fo quasi-standards allow anonymous
and isolated agencies to slowly become, layer after layer, <em>comparable</em>
and <em>commensurable</em>--which is surely a large part of what we mean by
being human. This common measurement depends, of course, on the <em>quality</em>
of what is transfereed. The question is not to fight against categories but
rather to ask: 'Is the catgory subjecting or <em> subjectifying</em> you?' As we
saw at the end of the last chapter, freedom is getting out of a <em>bad</em>
bondage, not the <em>absence</em> of bonds. The narrator continues: "[through
circulation] [. . . we ] become, layer after layer, comparable and commensurable . . . .
human. The question is not to fight against categories but rather to ask: 'Is
the category subjecting or subjectifying you . . . freedom is getting out of a
bad bondage, not an absence of bonds." All the world's a studio, and we are but
performers, transporting meanings through each lignin layer.
</p>
<p>09:25 On screen the audio editor, Garageband appears. The playhead scrolls over
several channels as the background sound track plays. The narrator continues:
I'm here and I'm talking about the social fluid, the liquid mixings of graphite
and wood, sound and light, felt-like, felt like the composing of self with
words. I'm a map. I'm a green tree.
</p>
<p>09:57 The cursor presses stop on the audio editor. The music stops. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>The video contains screen captures of materials gathered from the web. Three
images hosted on the flickr web site appear in the opening providing imagery of
a decaying leaf, a strand of wires, and a network visualization. Imagery with
colored pencils appears later in the piece. Web searches and pages from Google
books, Wikipedia, and Pandora are also captured. All of these are excerpts that are quoted and cited in the composition.</p>

<p>I'm a Map also includes materials from videos taken from Apple Computer's Get
a Mac advertising campaign. These make up the core of the intellectual argument
of the piece. The suggestion is that metaphors have become actualized as
characters as the logicial extension of posthuman blurrings of people and
machines. These are quoted and cited to present the "argument" of the piece.</p>

<p>The video also includes e-mail messages and a number of traditional
quotations. A screen capture of e-mail software shows items in an e-mail
conversation thread on a public mailing list. Quotations are captured using images that have been scanned from
books or journals. Excerpts from these scholarly materials are highlighted using
image editing software and cited.</p>

<p>The video also includes original materials by the author. An image editor
file is manipulated to deliver text and icons. And a soundtrack has been
composed using audio editing software.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>





<aside class="pullquote-right">Cinema does not have metaphor's specific power of
giving a 'subject' the verb or action of another subject; it has to juxtapose
the two subjects, and so make the metaphor subject to a metonymy. Cinema 2 155
</aside>

<p>This video was published in 2010 in <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric,
Technology, and Pedagogy</em>. A version of the piece was performed at the
Conference on College Composition and Communication in the spring of that year.
It brings together several segments of captured performance using a video
editor. The imagery highlights passages from books as a way of integrating scholarly citations into the video.
 Narration by the author discusses
materials, tracing connections between humans and machines. </p>


I'm a Map takes the proposition that "the
formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive" (Philosophy and Truth 88)
into the screen world through Apple Computer's Get a Mac advertising campaign.
The videos capture the ways attributes attach to actors in the dweeby PC and the
hip Mac characters. Words have a way of quickly
remixing concepts, as Giles Delueze explains. "Cinema cannot say with the poet:
'hands flutter'; it must first show hands being moved about quickly and then
leaves fluttering" (155). The characters, however, move in ways words cannot.
Discussing legal copy, power cords, and security protocols, Justin and John, Mac
and PC, take shape. Clearly, metaphor has entered a new space.</p>

<p> Posthuman perspectives reveal more about these transformations. In the audio
track of the piece, bubbles underwater can be heard regularly because connecting
two places creates "circuitry through which masses of entities begin to
circulate" (Reassembling the Social  196). When connecting things, what matters
are "the vehicles, the movements, the shifts, and the translation
<em>between</em> loci rather than the loci themselves" (196). Bruno Latour notes
how communication over time emerges "circulating through channels most easily
materialized by techniques--paper techniques and, more generally, intellectual
technologies being as important as gears, lever, and chemical bonds" (196).
The sounds of bubbles in water surface the ways that the environment out of which the
characters emerge circulates through multiple audiovisual channels.</p>

<p>The video brings citations to the screen; the narration adds commentary;
and there are some performances with software; however, for the most part the
soundtrack is the most unconventional aspect of I'm a Map. The looped base line
and shaker sounds evoke spoken word expectations. The sounds of thunder and water mix
with those of circuitry. Nietzsche says we seek metaphors "to refashion the
world," to make it "colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence,
charming, and eternally new" (89).

Metaphors work to capture concepts, Nietzsche tells us, but always become
"regular and rigid" until their power slips away. In response (or in circuit),
the intellect enchants, and rhapsodists act, until fixed concepts are "torn by
art" (89) that once again "throws metaphors into confusion and displaces the boundary
stones of abstractions" (90). For Latour, the shifting circulations make it so
that a network is a tracing of activity, and that writing itself is renewed as
the entities under consideration "are treated not as intermediaries but as
mediators" (Reassembling the Social 128). Even boundaries are caught up as the
whole network is put into motion and entities shape-shift among one another.
Composing works in similar ways, as does <em>I'm a Map</em> where shifting boundaries
evoke characters that blend humans and machines.

<aside class="pullquote-left"> If we have been able to show that glorified sites
like global or local were made out of circulating entities, why not postulate
that subjectivities, justifications, unconscious, and personalities would
<em>circulate</em> as well? </aside>






<p>Manning sees these circulations as "movement that foregrounds incipience
rather than displacement" (5). Following Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guittari as
well as Alfred North Whitehead, she explains that "events <em>create</em> time
and space" (7). Here, this movement is linked with composing through "the
pulling out of expression from the durational plane of experience" (7). Manning
offers dancing as an art linked with experiences of movement.
And she questions digital experiences where "you know in advance what could
happen" (65). Instead, we should "foreground the effects of unknowability that
are present in every movement" (65). Manning cites Henri Bergson, suggesting
"that movement need not be thought [of] . . . as a quantitative displacement from a to
b" (6). Instead, a focus on the "the immanence of movement moving," on the
possibilities of a before the closure of b, "opens up experience to the
unknowable" (7). </p>

<p>Technical systems, Manning worries, might limit unknowability. Again, taking
up dance, she suggests that "the 'emergent' quality of the system depends on how
a body moves with the software" (65). Movements should emerge with rather than
be predetermined by software. Software, of course, predetermines experiences.
Screen composing works against the grain of software, foregrounding movements
and unknowability, what Manning calls "[moving] toward relational eventfulness"
when capturing activities emerging in concert with software. "For this to take
place, recompositions of potential (movement taking-form through virtual
recombinations shape-shifting into displacements) are necessary, activated not
simply by or in relation to an external source but in tandem with the
co-composition of an event in the making" (65).

 </p>

<p>Deleuze notes that cinema can't mix concepts like "hands flutter" as easily
as words can, but adds that cinema can achieve metaphor through "the harmonics
of the image" (155). Not only can images have their distinct harmonics, they
resonate with both authors and viewers who "integrate thought into the image"
(156). This process, Deleuze (following Eisenstein) notes, creates "a circuit
which includes simultaneously the author, the film and the viewer" (156) In this
circuit, we find "action-thought," sublime movements that "effective or
metaphoric composition expresses" (157).  In the disruption of boundaries,
Nietzsche calls for "the intellect [to throw] the token of bondage from itself"
(90).  In writing about the social, Latour builds the network, puts it in
motion, then looks for levers and clamps. In eventful experiences, Manning
offers dancing. So many metaphors deployed to disrupt boundaries. In screen
composing, PC goes to Pandora and types in Shins.</p>
