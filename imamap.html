This video was published in 2010 in    <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</em>. A version
    of the piece was performed at the Conference on College Composition and
    Communication in the spring of that year. The piece brings together several
    performances that capture websites and software. The imagery highlights
    passages from books as a way of integrating scholarly materials into the
    video.
</p>
<p>
    Although the audio track with ambient sounds drifts somewhat from familiar
    forms of scholarship, this video presents materials in a reasonably
    straightforward way. Scans from books and articles introduce academic
    concerns. The narrative track moves viewers through the concerns and
    provides context. The piece also includes clips from Apple's "Get a Mac"
    advertising campaign that embody intellectual concerns and further the
    discussion.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

 <p>
    00:00 The video opens with a black screen; the rhythm of a shaker marking
    time is audible. The sound of thunder can be heard. An image of a decaying
    leaf, in black and white, appears on screen. The sound of bubbles
    underwater can be heard. On screen, the image zooms out to reveal the leaf
    image hosted on the Flickr website. The cursor selects a thumbnail icon,
    and an image of multicolored wires appears. A title appears on screen: "I'm
    a Map I'm a Green Tree."
</p>
<p>
    00:40 On screen, the term "network" is typed into Flickr's search field.
    The narrator begins: "I'm here and I'm talking about how people, ideas, and
    things fit together. How we represent culture with maps or ecologies. How
    we render something like Flickr: people, gathered in groups, a network of
    connections."
</p>
<p>
    01:02 On screen, the network image is replaced with the decaying leaf,
    which is resized to fill the screen. The narrator continues: "Or, we look
    to the living world for models. Of this image, we're told, 'microbes in the
    soil consume the leaf's soft tissue and leave only the cellulose and lignin
    skeleton.' The Flickr image suggests space, the leaf says time, the slow
    decay paradoxically revealing connections. It's these connections we're
    about to explore."
</p>
<p>
    01:30 On screen, the window holding the leaf dissolves into a search field
    containing the phrase "language paradox." The cursor selects a link from
the results, and a page from a book appears on screen: page three from    <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em> by Cleanth Brooks. The narrator continues:
    "Let's start . . . with language. I'm here and I'm talking about flow
    zones, those spaces where transformation happens, the in-betweens where we
    find the breathing current."
</p>
<p>
01:47 The sound of electric current can be heard. A passage from    <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em> is highlighted: "of paradox; apparently the
    truth which the poet utters can be approached only in terms of paradox."
    The narrator continues: "This is old style, the focus zoomed smack dab to
    the printed word. 'The truth which the poet utters can be approached only
    in terms of paradox.' We bring new focus now, but wow, that's some hard
    commitment to the power of the written, or here the spoken, word."
</p>
<p>
    02:11 The cursor scrolls through the book. The screen zooms into a new page
    and a passage is highlighted: "[The poet must] work by analogies, metaphors
    do not lie in the same plane or fit neatly edge to edge. There is a
    continual tilting of the planes; necessary overlappings, discrepancies,
    contradictions." The narrator continues: "Metaphors do not lie in the same
    plane or fit neatly edge to edge. There is a continual tilting . . .
    necessary overlappings, discrepancies, contradictions."
</p>
<p>
    02:24 The screen zooms in on the passage and a word is highlighted:
    "contradictions." The sound of thunder cracks. The narrator continues: "The
    edges of paradox emerge with words arrayed and linked to new ideas. Like
    how the tenor of the metaphor makes way for its vehicle."
</p>
<p>
    02:39 The Wikipedia entry for "metaphor" fills the screen, and a passage is
    copied, and then pasted into a text editor: "[metaphor] is in two parts:
    the tenor and the vehicle. The tenor is the subject to which attributes are
    ascribed. The vehicle is the subject whose attributes are borrowed. Other
    writers employ the general terms ground and figure to denote tenor and the
vehicle. Consider the All the world's a stage [monologue from    <em>As You Like It</em>.]" The narrator continues: "Words cross the
    connotational space, where one idea flows into another, where meaning
    develops. In poetry we call for vehicles, red wheelbarrows from which we
    borrow attributes, modes of transport that bring the associations of one
    element into circuit . . . with another."
</p>
<p>
    03:05 The sound of a jet flying past is heard. A web page hosted by
    Apple.com appears on screen, with the page heading: "Get a Mac—Watch the TV
    Ads." A video titled "Trust Mac" begins to play. The video shows two
    figures against a white background. The figure on the right in a blue shirt
    says, "Hello, I'm a Mac." The figure on the left in a trench coat says,
    "And I am no one." The video's audio is lowered and the narrator continues:
    "I'm a Mac. I'm a PC. This commingling of human and machine reveals the
    back and forth coursing of attributes. Virus. Spyware. Glasses. Cool shirt.
    The machine and human coinforming each other."
</p>
<p>
    03:35 The volume in the video is turned up and the figure in the trench
    coat says, "You never saw me." The figure in the blue shirts responds,
    "Never saw who," and winks. The figure in the trench coat says, "Me, PC."
</p>
<p>
    03:43 A scanner software window slowly loads an image from a book. A
callout with citation information appears: "Latour, Bruno.    <em>Reassembling the Social</em>. Oxford University Press, 2005." The
    scanned page is enlarged and a passage highlighted: "To make it fit our
    purposes we have to add a fourth feature that, I agree, breaks down the
    original metaphor somewhat: a network is not made of nylon thread, words or
    any durable substance but is the trace left behind by some moving agent. It
    has to be traced anew by the passage of another vehicle, another
    circulating entity." The narrator continues: "The Mac or PC metaphors show
    how people, ideas, and things flow together in cultural networks. The
    currents circulate, back and forth. A network . . . it's the trace left
    behind by some moving agent. It has to be traced anew by the passage of
    another vehicle, another circulating entity. The red wheelbarrow depends
    upon the bicycle and the bus driver being on time."
</p>
<p>
    04:15 On screen, an image hosted on Flickr showing brightly colored pencils
    is selected and enlarged. As the mouse hovers over the tips of pencils,
    callouts appear with descriptions: "Fantastic detail," "Wow . . . texture,"
    "amazing use of the focus ;)," "I love this color :D great job!" The
    narrator continues: "Moving entities, tracing and circulating. 'Fantastic
    detail,' 'Wow . . . Texture.' 'Amazing focus.' 'My favorite color.'
    Relationships growing within flowing networks of red, umber, pencil, power
    cords. Power chords." The sound of a shaker and steady bass line can be
    heard.
</p>
<p>
    04:40 The sound of a passing jet can be heard. On screen, the Apple
    commercial titled "Accident" fills the screen. In the video, a figure on
    the right in a blue shirt says, "Hello, I'm a Mac." A figure on the left in
    a brown suit seated in a wheelchair and wearing casts on both arms and one
    leg says, "And I'm a PC." The Mac character says, "I'm afraid to ask." The
    PC character replies, "Well, I was sitting at my desk. Someone walked by,
    carelessly tripped over my power cord, yanked me straight down to the
    ground, bam." The Mac character responds, "Yikes. Macbooks come with this
    power cord that connects magnetically, so, when it gets pulled it just pops
    right off. Everything is just kind of thought out, you know like the tiny
    built in iSight camera, or . . ." The PC character responds, "My life is
    flashing before my eyes. I see a sunset in a field of beautiful wheat." The
    Mac character responds, "Isn't that your screensaver?" The PC character
    responds, "Yeah."
</p>
<p>
    05:12 The screen dissolves into an email thread responding to the query:
    "If either Mac or PC were setting up a Pandora radio station, what song or
    artist would they use to get started?" The cursor copies and pastes
    responses into a text editor, then copies some of the responses into an
    image editor. Text and icons are manipulated in the image editor. The
    narrator continues: "What follows is we find ourselves awash amid entities
    that give and take shape among one another: The Shins, Kelly Clarkson, Mac
    mail, Mastodon, web mail, copy, paste, copy, paste, power cords, empathy,
    celebrity, sharing, IP, music, text, text editor, Justin, John, Hannah,
    Lady Gaga, cheesy, ukulele, sun, dust, rolling thunder, clouds crowding . .
    . circulating collections of people, ideas, and things."
</p>
<p>
    06:04 On screen, a software window appears, scanning a page from a book. A
    passage is highlighted: "[Subjects are no more] autochthonous than
    face-to-face interactions. They, too, depend on a flood of entities to
    exist. To be an 'actor' is now at last a fully artificial and fully
    traceable gathering." The narrator continues: "[We] depend on a flood . . .
    of entities to exist. To be an actor is now at last a fully artificial and
    fully traceable . . . gathering." The sound of a shaker and steady bass
    line can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    06:17 A video fills the screen. Against a white background, three figures
    stand. On the right is a figure in a light blue shirt. On the left is a
    figure in a brown suit. Behind these is a figure in a dark suit with dark
    glasses. The figure on the right says, "Hello, I'm a Mac." The figure in
    the back says, "Mac has issued a salutation, cancel or allow?" The figure
    in the brown suit responds, "Allow. And I'm a PC." The figure in the back
    says, "You are returning Mac's salutation, cancel or allow?" The PC
    character says, "Allow." The Mac character asks, "Okay, what gives?" The
    figure in the back says, "Mac is asking a question, cancel or allow?" The
    PC character responds, "Allow. He's part of Vista, my new operating system.
    PCs have a lot of security problems, so he asks me to authorize pretty much
    anything I do."
</p>
<p>
    06:36 The audio on the video is lowered. The narrator continues: "The
    concern is that these networks constrain us, shape us, and tell us who we
    are."
</p>
<p>
    06:43 The volume on the video is restored and the figure in the back of the
    video says, "You are coming to a sad realization, cancel or allow?" The PC
    character says, "Allow."
</p>
<p>
    06:48 On screen, a new video from the "Get a Mac" campaign appears. On the
    right is a figure in a light blue shirt. On the left is a figure in a brown
    shirt. As the video plays, a block of text in small font appears at the
    bottom of the screen, partially obscuring the feet of the two characters.
    The narrator continues: "The gatherings threaten the human figure by
    binding us together, surrounding us with ideas and things." The sound of a
    shaker and steady bass line can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    06:58 On screen, more small text is added, continuing to cover the figures.
    The Mac character says, "Did your legal copy just grow?" The PC character
    responds, "Yeah, you see, usually PCs require a lot of regular maintenance,
    downloading security patches, virus scans. I can't just go out there and
    say, 'hey, getting started on PC is the easiest thing in the world.'" More
    small text is added, further covering the figures. The Mac character says,
    "Whoa. That's a lot of legal copy." The PC character says, "Watch this. PCs
    are now 100% trouble free." A large block of small text completely covers
    both characters. The Mac character says, "Look at that." The PC character
    responds, "That's a lot of legal copy."
</p>
<p>
    07:19 A scanning software window appears, and then a scan from a book is
    manipulated in an image editor. The narrator continues: "But there is also
    an organic flow as we gather together in circuit with machines, an entity
    among entities, conduit for streams of meaning-making and performing
    action, never powerless, full of awareness of layerings, knowing that
    categories (like worlds) can still bring us, transformation." On screen,
    the scanned page from the book is rotated in the image editor. The view
    zooms into the layers palette of the image editor and the cursor highlights
    a layer with the label Transformation. The sound of electricity passing
    through a circuit can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    07:45 On screen, the Pandora website appears, and "shins" is typed into a
    search field. The narrator continues: "I'm here and I'm talking about
    fitting in. PC goes to Pandora and types in Shins. The machine responds.
    The composition is one of mixing, but the zoom is way out. Choosing word
    over image or sound feels myopic. The composing here is one of entity in
    flowing network, not type cast, but acting." The sound of a shaker and
    steady bass line can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    08:10 On screen, the image editor reappears. The cursor manipulates a
    scanned page from a book. The narrator continues: "I'm talking about
    performing. The way the network is never hung up to dry, but always in
    motion, always calling us to be . . . composing. What is a text? What
    isn't? What is writing? The paintbrush. The poet. The CPU. The lungs. The
    organic mechanic typing song as worlds unfold in the streaming cast.
    Fantastic detail. What focus did you use? My favorite color. . . ." In the
    scanned page from the book, a passage has been highlighted: "Writing
    describes a subset of rhetoric: those productions whose mode of delivery is
    written language. In composition-as-rhetoric, a wordless cartoon or a
    minor-key melody may be an acceptable target discourse. In
    composition-as-writing, they would not (though an intermingling of word and
    image in some fuzzy ratio and relationship would)."
</p>
<p>
    08:50 The scanning window reappears, and then a scan from a book is opened
    in an image editor. A passage is highlighted: "Rather, the circulation of
    quasi-standards allow[s] anonymous and isolated agencies to slowly become,
    layer after layer, comparable and commensurable—which is surely a large
    part of what we mean by being human. This common measurement depends, of
    course, on the quality of what is transferred. The question is not to fight
    against categories but rather to ask: 'Is the category subjecting or
    subjectifying you?' As we saw at the end of the last chapter, freedom is
    getting out of a bad bondage, not the absence of bonds." The narrator
    continues: "Through circulation . . . we become, layer after layer,
    comparable and commensurable . . . human. The question is not to fight
    against categories but rather to ask: 'Is the category subjecting or
    subjectifying you . . . freedom is getting out of a bad bondage, not an
    absence of bonds.' All the world's a studio, and we are but performers and
    mechanics, transporting meanings through each lignin layer." The sound of a
    shaker and steady bass line can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    09:25 On screen, the GarageBand audio editor appears. The playhead scrolls
    over several channels as the background sound track plays. The sound of a
    shaker and steady bass line can be heard as the playhead moves over their
    clips in the audio composition. The narrator continues: "I'm here and I'm
    talking about the connotational flow, the liquid mixings of sound and
    light, felt-like, felt like the composing of self with . . . words.
</p>
<p>
    09.40 The playhead passes over an audio clip on the timeline. The sound of
    thunder is heard. The narrator concludes: "I'm a map. I'm a green tree."
</p>
<p>
    09:57 The cursor presses stop on the audio editor. The sound of a shaker
    and steady bass line stops. The video ends.

    The video contains screen captures gathered from the web, including imagery
    of a decaying leaf, a strand of wires, a network visualization, and colored
    pencils. Web searches and pages from Google books, Wikipedia, and Pandora
    are also captured. The video also includes items in an email conversation
    thread on a public mailing list. Quotations are also captured using images
    that have been scanned from books or journals.
</p>
<p>
    Materials from Apple's "Get a Mac" advertising campaign provide key aspects
    of the intellectual argument. The suggestion is that metaphors have become
    actualized as characters, embodying posthuman blurrings of people and
    machines. The video also includes original materials by the author. An
    image editor file is manipulated to deliver text and icons. And a
    soundtrack has been composed using audio editing software.

<h4>Discussion</h4>




<aside class="pullquote-right">Cinema does not have metaphor's specific power of giving a "subject" the
    verb or action of another subject; it has to juxtapose the two subjects,
    and so make the metaphor subject to a metonymy. <span
class="attribution">Gilles Deleuze, <span class="attribution-title">Cinema 2</span> (155)</span>
</aside>

<p>
    In 2006, Apple released its "Get a Mac" advertising campaign. The series
    features two characters, one somewhat geeky (PC, played by John Hodgman)
    and the other quite cool (Mac, played by Justin Long). The campaign speaks
    to intellectual concerns linked with screen composing. The idea that
    materials and technologies have agency is captured as the two computing
    platforms are cast as actors. 
    Nietzsche tells us that "the formation of metaphors is the fundamental
    human drive" (88). The function of metaphors is to link attributes from one
    entity to another. Here, the machine and human attributes flow in both
    directions as the senses we identify with the PC and Mac come together as
    characters.
</p>
<p>
    <em>I'm a Map</em>
    uses the screen to explore this human-machine connection. Rendering
    concepts through metaphor shifts as representation moves from words to
    audiovisual media. As Gilles Deleuze explains, "cinema cannot say with the
    poet: 'hands flutter'; it must first show hands being moved about quickly
    and then leaves fluttering" (155). The characters in <em>I'm a Map</em>,
    however, embody aspects of computing platforms. Discussing legal copy,
    power cords, and security protocols, Justin and John, Mac and PC, take
    shape amid networks, generating and representing attributes linked with
    their respective machines. Clearly, metaphor has entered a new space.
</p>
<p>
    Exploring these characters through video scholarship creates more exchanges
    of meaning. In the audio track, bubbles underwater can be heard regularly.
    This bubbling evokes the flows "through which masses of entities begin to
    circulate" (196), to use a favorite metaphor of Bruno Latour. When
    connecting things, what matters are "the vehicles, the movements, the
    shifts" (196). We know metaphors are vehicles for moving ideas,
    "circulating through channels most easily materialized by techniques—paper
    techniques and, more generally, intellectual technologies being as
    important as gears, levers, and chemical bonds" (196). Latour starts with
    paper techniques for moving meaning. The sounds of bubbles in water evoke
    similar circulations through audio channels.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the soundtrack is the most unconventional scholarly aspect of    <em>I'm a Map</em>. The looped baseline and shaker sounds evoke spoken word
    expectations. The sounds of thunder and water mix with those of circuitry.
    Nietzsche says that we seek metaphors "to refashion the world," to make it
    "colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and
    eternally new" (89). Metaphors work to capture concepts, but always become
    "regular and rigid" until their power slips away. In response (or in
    circuit), the intellect enchants and rhapsodists act, until fixed concepts
    are "torn by art" (89) that once again "throws metaphors into confusion and
    displaces the boundary stones of abstractions" (90). The disruptions remake
    meaning. For Latour, the renewal comes when the entities "are treated not
    as intermediaries but as mediators" (128), when they move and shape-shift
    among one another in the network. <em>I'm a Map</em> creates new circuits
    using bubbles and electric buzzing.

<aside class="pullquote-left">If we have been able to show that glorified sites like global or local were
    made out of circulating entities, why not postulate that subjectivities,
    justifications, unconscious, and personalities would <em>circulate</em> as
    well? <span class="attribution">Bruno Latour, <span class="attribution-title">Reassembling the Social</span> (207)</span></aside>






<p>
    Erin Manning sees circulation as "movement that foregrounds incipience
    rather than displacement" (5). Following Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari,
    as well as Alfred North Whitehead, she explains that "events create time
    and space" (7). This movement is linked with composing through "the pulling
    out of expression from the durational plane of experience" (7). Manning
    offers dancing as an art linked with experiences of movement. And she
    questions digital experiences where "you know in advance what could happen"
    (65). Instead, we should "foreground the effects of unknowability that are
    present in every movement" (65). Manning cites Henri Bergson, suggesting
    "that movement need not be thought [of] . . . as a quantitative
    displacement from a to b" (6). Instead, focusing on "the immanence of
movement moving," on the possibilities of <em>a</em> before the closure of    <em>b</em>, "opens up experience to the unknowable" (7).
</p>

    Technical systems, Manning worries, might limit unknowability. Of
    technology and dance, she suggests, "the 'emergent' quality of the system
    depends on how a body moves with the software" (65). Movements should
    emerge with—rather than be predetermined by—technologies. Video scholarship
    foregrounds the ways software and composers codetermine experiences through
    what Manning calls "[moving] toward relational eventfulness." In coemergent
    fashion, we work with and against the grain of software. "For this to take
    place, recompositions of potential (movement taking-form through virtual
    recombinations shape-shifting into displacements) are necessary" (65).
    These shape-shiftings activate circuits where agency flows both ways as
    composing plays out.

    Deleuze notes that cinema can't mix concepts like "hands flutter" as easily
    as words can, but adds that cinema can achieve metaphor through "the
    harmonics of the image" (155). Not only can images have their distinct
    harmonics, they resonate with both authors and viewers who "integrate
    thought into the image" (156). This process, Deleuze (following Sergei
    Eisenstein) notes, creates "a circuit which includes simultaneously the
    author, the film and the viewer" (156). In this circuit, we find
    "action-thought," sublime movements that "metaphoric composition expresses"
    (157). Seeking disruption, Nietzsche calls for "the intellect [to throw]
    the token of bondage from itself" (90). In writing about the social, Latour
    builds the network, puts it in motion, then looks for levers and gears. In
    eventful experiences, Manning offers dancing. So many metaphors deployed to
    disrupt (or remake) boundaries. In screen composing, PC goes to Pandora and
    types in Shins.
