  <p>This video brings together two recordings of screen performances. On
screen, a number of videos play, including one with a live musical performance
and one  that captures a multimedia documentary about an abandoned town in
Canada. These materials play while the cursor moves through a series of blog
postings in web browser windows.The blog postings are copied into a text editing
file, and autocomplete and word counting tools are used to manipulate the text.
</p>

  <p>00:00  A video hosted by YouTube with the title, "Postcard from 1952
  (Live) - Explosions in the Sky," appears in the upper left of the screen. In
  the upper right, a video player window with the heading “Postcard from 1952
  Typing.mov” appears. The cursor clicks the play button on the
  YouTube clip, starting a live musical performance of the song, “Postcard from 1952."
  Enthusiastic crowd noise is heard. The cursor clicks play on the video player in the upper right,
  and a recording of text being typed begins.</p>

  <p>00:20 A new Safari web browser window appears showing a Twitter timeline.
  A spotlight illuminates the cursor, which scans over a tweet that reads,
  “Anyone remember name of multimedia project from last year or so about
  abandoned/demolished town in alaska (I think).” Band banter and crowd noise is
  heard. The scrollbar is moved up in the Twitter timeline and a spotlight
  illuminates the cursor moving over another tweet, which reads, “@iamdan Is
  this it Dan? Welcome to Pine Point (Canada, not Alaska):
  doclab.org/2010/Welcome-t. . .” </p>

  <p>00:33 A new Chrome web browser window appears, covering the whole screen.
  The window contains the results of a google search for “welcome to pine
  point.” A band member can be heard saying to the crowd, “It’s a privilege to
  be in front of you. We are called Explosions in the Sky and we come from
  Texas.” The cursor clicks on the link for the first search item and the web
  site pinepoint.nfb.ca/#/pinepoint with the title “NFB – Welcome to Pine Point"
  is loaded into the Chrome web browser, filling the background of the screen. A
  text editing window appears in the foreground,  titled “printcentricity is
  sneaky.” The file is empty. Buzzing bees can be heard. The
  sound of the live musical performance can be heard as the band begins to play.
  </p>

  <p>00:45 A new Safari web browser window is opened, covering the text editing
  window and showing an article, titled “The Digital Humanities and the Transcending
  of Mortality –NYTimes.com.” The cursor highlights the first sentence of the
  article: “This is a blog.” The sound of someone speaking in a hoarse voice can
  be heard: “mouse click, tab, 579, click.” A video player window showing blue
  sky and vapor trails appears on screen. A video player window showing an old man making enormous
  soap bubbles on a beach appears on screen. The cursor selects the text in the
  article. A dialog box opens, and Copy is selected. Someone speaking can be
  heard: “mouse click. Backspace 10.” The cursor moves the browser window with
  the article off screen.  </p>

  <p>01:00 The Chrome browser window with the “Welcome to Pine Point” project
  is brought to the front. A collage of hand-drawn images blended with old
  photographs fills the window. The text editor window is brought forward and
  moved to the top-right quadrant of the screen. The cursor clicks in the text
  editor window, and then pastes text into the text file.  Two videos, one showing a man blowing
  large bubbles and the other showing jet plane vapor trails the sky, are brought forward. The cursor manipulates these various windows.</p>

  <p>01:18 A Safari browser window slides onto the screen. At the top is the
  heading, “Using BBAutoComplete.” A spotlight appears, highlighting the cursor,
  which scans text reading: “type the first few letters of a long word in one of
  the supported applications . . . BBAutocomplete looks backwards from the
  current insertion point to the beginning of the document . . . Next it looks
  forwards.” The “Using BBAutocomplete” browser window is minimized and slides
 off the screen. On screen, images (and sounds) from the “Pine Point” project
  and other media and browser windows intermingle. </p>

  <p>01:32 The text editor window is brought forward. A small text editor dialog
  box with the title, Scripts, appears. In the dialog box is a highlighted phrase (BBAutocomplete) with a
  keyboard shortcut next to it (command-/). The cursor is placed at the top of
  the text editor window and begins typing. Letters begin to appear on the
  screen at the point of the cursor: “We seek c.” The cursor moves down and
  selects a button in the Scripts dialog box that says Run. In the text editor
  window, the letter c is autocompleted to read "column." The button is clicked
  again and the word becomes "clog." The cursor
  continues to type and play with the autocomplete function. </p>

  <p>01:59 The Chrome browser window with the “Welcome to Pine
  Point” project fills with a white background over which an animated cut out of
  a bird moves from right to left in the lower portion of the screen. The text
  editing box and YouTube window sporadically appear and disappear in front of
  the “Pine Point” background. The sound of a bird chirping can be heard,
  mingled with soft organ sounds and the live musical performance.
  </p>

  <p>02:08 In the text box, the copied opening paragraph of the NYTimes.com
  article is visible: “This is a blog. There, I’ve said it. . . .”  In the
  Chrome browser window with the “Welcome to Pine Point" project, the animated
  bird grasps a piece of yarn in its beak and flies off, dragging new imagery
  onto the screen, including a scan of a flyer with a line drawing of a figure
  in a welder’s mask. At the top of the scan is a label that reads: "Ads from
  Pinepoint Yearbooks." In the text editor window, the cursor deletes text until
  the phrase, "We seek tr" remains. The run button is clicked, and “tr” becomes
  "traditional." The Run button is clicked, and traditional becomes "transform."
  The cursor begins typing, and transform become
  "transformation." From the "Welcome to Pinepoint" project, a voice begins to
  speak: “I don’t think I’ve ever had closure with Pine Point. I always. I
  always feel sad when I, like you said, when I tell somebody I grew up in Pine
  Point and they ask me when do I come back. I go, Oh, it’s not there anymore.’
  And I do feel a sense of, I don’t know what it is. For me it’s weird to say
  that I don’t have. . . .” </p>

  <p>02:33 In the “Pine Point” window, which constitutes the backdrop
  of the screen, imagery from the abandoned town and scraps of text from interviews
  appear. One passage reads: “When I look at people’s faces in the old Pine
  Point photos, there’s no sense of hesitation, no hint that they knew that one
  day this might all end.” The scrollbar in the text editing window is moved to
  the bottom of the page. The Scripts dialog box for the text editor is replaced
  with an Info dialog box. In the video player window, part of the typing text is
  visible: “When I started out. . . . / There seemed to be a difference. . . . / An
  old man . . . making movies.” The Info dialog box contains the name of the
  text file (“printcentricity is sneaky”) and entries indicating number counts:
  “Chars 13,831, Words 2,218, Lines 27, Pages 0.” The cursor turns into a
  spotlight, illuminating the four entries. </p>

  <p>02:55 A Chrome browser window is brought on screen. The window contains
  search results for “welcome to pine point” and has nine tabs with additional
  pages listed at the top. The cursor resizes the window and moves it to the
  lower-right of the screen. The first of the nine tabs is clicked, and a web
  page is loaded into the browser window. In the body of the page, there is a
  blog posting. The text of the blog posting is selected, and copied. The cursor moves up
  and selects the text editor window. New text is pasted into the window. The
  text editor Info dialog box appears on screen. The cursor becomes a spotlight
  and illuminates the Info dialog box, which displays new numbers in each of the
  count fields: “Chars 22,199; Words 3,581; Lines 151; Pages 0.” The “Pine
  Point” backdrop shows a grid of home videos and footage from the Canadian
  town. </p>

  <p>03:17 The cursor selects the second of the nine additional tabs in the
  Chrome browser window, and copies the text of the blog posting. The
  live musical performance continues to play. The sound of a
  small, two-stroke motor can be heard. The text editor window is brought forward, and new
  text is pasted into the window. The Info dialog box is brought on screen. The
  cursor turns into a spotlight and illuminates the changing word, character,
  and line counts. The cursor selects the third of the nine additional tabs,
  copies the text of the blog posting, and then pastes it into the text editor
  window. The Info dialog box appears and the cursor turns into a spotlight
  illuminating the changing counts. The sound of a
  small two-stroke engine continues as the hi-hat taps rhythmically in the musical
  performance.   </p>

  <p>03:46 The fourth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The sound of the
  two-stroke engine fades out and a woman’s voice is heard: “Good morning,
  Laurie, how are you?” A second voice is heard: “Good morning, I’m fine
  thanks.” The first voice begins to talk, “good,” but the second voice
  continues before trailing off: “It’s a very busy Thursday, and we’d like to
  thank all of the people of Pine Point.” Their words are muffled by the
  cheering of the crowd in the video with the musical performance. The text of the blog posting
  is copied and pasted into the text editor; the changing counts are
  highlighted.   </p>

  <p>03:59 The fifth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The text of the blog
  posting is copied. The sound of a small child can be heard. The second voice
  is heard: “I only wish we could stay till the end.” New text is pasted into
  the text editor. The Info dialog box appears, shows new counts, then
  disappears. The first voice is heard: “Yes. How long have you been here in
  Pine Point, Laurie?” Second voice: “I came here on Labor Day weekend, 1970.”
  First voice: “For heaven’s sakes. That’s a long time.”   </p>

  <p>04:13 The sixth of the nine browser tabs is clicked, its text is
  copied, and then pasted into the text editor window. The Info box is highlighted with new counts: “Chars 48,564,
  Words 8,063, Lines 436, Pages 0.” The video of vapor trails is just
  visible on the left side of the screen. The voices in the “Pine Point” project
  continue. Second voice: “Almost sixteen years.” First voice: “Yeah. I know
  I’ve been very pleased with all your products and service. So I personally
  would want to thank you.” Second voice: “Thank you very much we appreciate
  that.” First voice: “Okay, lots of luck.” Second voice: “Okay thanks.” The
  seventh browser tab is selected, its text copied, and pasted into the text
  editor. The Info box is brought on screen: “Chars 73,231; Words 12,340; Lines
  681; Pages 0.”   </p>

  <p>04:32 The eighth of the nine browser tabs is selected, text is copied, then
  pasted into the text editor. The Info box is brought on the screen: “Chars
  77,317; Words 12,981; Lines 719; Pages 0.” Coming from the “Pine Point” project in the
  background, the two-stroke engine can be heard as images of people working and
  living in a snowy town appear. In the live musical performance,
  enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard.  </p>

  <p>04:42 The ninth browser tab is clicked. The text is copied, and then the
  window is moved off the screen.  In the video player window showing typing, the words “Craft. /
  Teaching. / A child. / Videos. / Transfer” appear. The video with enormous
  bubbles (“words are not memories.mov”) is brought back on screen. The cursor
  moves to the text editor and pastes text into the file. The Info box is
  highlighted: “Chars 82,241; Words 13,759; Lines 757; Pages 0.”  </p>

  <p>04:57 The cursor clicks on the scrollbar in the text editor window and
  moves it to the top. At the top are the words, “We seek transformation.” The
  word transformation is deleted, and “to be s” is typed. The text at top of the
  page now reads “We seek to be s.” The Scripts dialog box of the text editor is
  brought on screen, and the Run button for the BBAutoComplete function is
  selected. The autocomplete function inserts the word "seek" at the end of the
  line. The button is pressed again: “seek” becomes “should.” In the Scripts
  window, the Run button is selected multiple times: should becomes “sake,”
  “sea,” “said,” “shifts,” “scholarly,” “scholarship,” “so,” “several.”  </p>

  <p>05:20 The cursor at the top of the text editor flashes at the end of the
  phrase, “we seek to be several.” The cursor begins typing: “things and we want
  to make things.” The typing continues: “There are more than enough of the old
  things in place.”  The music performance gains more energy as the YouTube
  video shows the band members picking on electric guitars.  </p>

  <p>05:40 On screen, imagery from the media windows appears: band members
  playing the live performance; large soap bubbles; sky with jet plane vapor
  trails. The sound of the musical performance can be heard. In the video
  player showing typing, words continue to appear: “Turning. / Gone. / Some point. /
  California.” In the text editor, the typing continues: “This is the place
  where we make scholarly w.”  </p>

  <p>06:00 The cursor clicks on the Run button in the Scripts window. In the
  text editor, “w” becomes “we.” The button is clicked multiple times: “we”
  becomes “where,” “want,” “what,” “with,” “went,” “who.” The cursor deletes the
  word “who” and types, “where are the waves?”   </p>

  <p>06:12 In the text editor, the cursor types: “We seek w.” The cursor moves
  down to the Scripts dialog box and clicks Run. In the text editor, “w” is
  replaced with “waves.” Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. Typing
  continues: “We have found them!!!!”  </p>

  <p>06:29 On screen, imagery from the media windows appears: an old man making
  soap bubbles with two long sticks; sky and vapor trails. In the text editor,
  typing and the use of the autocomplete feature continues until a phrase is
  produced: “We feel them flowing through the screen.”  On screen in a video
  window, vapor trails are colored bright orange against a dark sky, resonating
  with a fire burning in the snow, visible in the “Pine Point” project playing
  in the background. The bubble in the video with the old man on the beach is awash in color. </p>

  <p>06:59 The cursor minimizes the text editor window. On screen, multiple
  videos play. In the upper-right of the screen, the "Pine Point" project in the
  background shows a burning pile of debris. In the lower-middle of the screen,
  a video player shows a plane from below against a blue sky trailing streaks of
  white vapor. The video in the lower-left shows the old man blowing huge bubbles on the
  beach, then fades out. More words appear in the video player in the lower right: “Papers. /
  Making. / Ambient. / Narratives. / Tracks.”  </p>

  <p>07:11 A small video player window slides onto the bottom-right of screen
  showing a line of text that says, “Credit and Much Appreciation to." At the
  top is the title: “worried about rigor?.mov.” The cursor selects the play
  button on the video, and a list of sources begins to scroll from right to left.
  </p>

  <p>07:21 The live musical performance can be heard reaching its climax.  The
  crowd can be heard cheering. A Chrome browser window in the background is
  selected and the "Welcome to Pine Point" project fills the screen. The cursor
  moves over the Pine Point project and selects a video thumbnail that shows a
  middle-aged man and woman in an office. The video begins playing and a woman’s
  voice is heard: “Excuse me doctor. You said you’ve been here since . . . you
  started coming here since when?” [A cash register sound is heard.]  A second
  voice is heard: “1964.”  The first voice can be heard: “What about, we’ve got
  a couple of ladies here, a receptionist and a nurse. How about them. What will
  they be doing?”  </p>

  <p>07:46 On screen, imagery from media windows appears: large soap bubbles;
  the band playing; vapor trials. The sounds of the musical performance
  concluding can be heard. Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. In the office
  video, only one smiling woman is visible, on the far left of the screen. The
  first voice continues: “Are they gonna be here same as you?” The second voice:
  “Oh, they’re gonna be here for a long time." [The voice stretches out the word
  “long” and lightly chuckles when speaking.] A third voice is heard as the
  woman speaks: “I guess I’ll probably be here till the summer sometime.” The
  first voice is heard: “Till the summer, eh?” The third voice is heard:
  “Right.”  The first voice can be heard: “You’re gonna, you’re gonna be one of
  the ones that, ah, puts the lights out? [laughter] Me too.”  The crowd cheers
  in the musical performance video. The cursor moves media windows off the screen until only
  the “Pine Point” project is on the screen.  </p>

  <p>08:13 The sound of laughter and the first voice can be heard: “I talked
  to Lynn. She’s gonna be here too, so there’ll be three of us.” Soft, steady
  organ notes are heard. The first voice can be heard: “Well it’s been very nice
  for you to give me the time, and, uh, thank you again.” The cursor moves to
  the top of the Chrome browser window with the “Pine Point” project and selects
  the Back button. The video stops. </p>

<button class="accordion">Materials and Sources</button> <div
class="panel">

<p>The central components of the project are the blog postings that are used to
compile the text that is manipulated on screen.   A total of ten blog postings
are included, and the entire text of each posting is used. Another key piece in
the video is the "Welcome to Pine Point" media project. The project is
included in all but thirty-six seconds of the piece, but makes up a small
portion of the whole experience, as the materials that are on screen at any
given moment are layered together with browser and media windows.</p>

<p>Several videos and compilations are also included. A video with a live
performance of the song, "Postcard from 1952," is woven into the audio track
and plays continuously.  Both "Pine Point" and "Postcard from 1952" evoke messages
that resonate with the passing of time and a sense of loss. The materials are
meant to convey nostalgia. </p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The authoring and reading environments for interpretative scholarly work
are only just beginning to be designed in such a way that the linear, finite
conventions of print media can be changed for the constellationary, distributed,
multi-faceted modes of digital media. <span class="attribution">Joanna Drucker, "Humanities Approaches to Interface
Theory" (2)</span></aside>

<p>On January 9th, 2012, Stanley Fish published an opinion piece in <em>The New York
Times</em> that self-consciously identified itself as a blog posting and challenged
the transformative potential of the digital humanities. In the days that
followed, countless responses were posted on blogs. <em>Waves</em> is a speculative test
of what a response to Fish and to those subsequent blog postings might look like in
video form. The video was made through by live capturing screen
activities (with minor post-capture editing to add a list of sources). This
process was used twice, once to capture a base layer with the media
elements of the video and a second time to capture activities performed with
blog postings and a text editor. The video was posted to Vimeo on January 23rd, 2012.</p>

<p>Dwight Conquergood calls for a performance that emphasizes "a decentering
agency of movement, intervention, transformation, struggle, and change" (19).
The performances in <em>Waves</em> seek these transformations by bringing
together humans, networks, and software through activities of representation.
This video features humans and machines performing together. An unseen mouse
click brings a Twitter timeline on screen. A keyboard shortcut transforms the
cursor into a spotlight or brings up a dialog box with a word count. These
human-computer interactions illuminate co-emergence as software is used to
compose and the author and operating system mix.  The creation is kinetic and
linked with the body. The hand must click to bring forth the window. On screen,
layers of hardware and software respond to create meaning. The use of a cursor
spotlight focuses attention, as the circle of light moves and creates emphasis.
The mouse and machine mark out meaning through a kind of exchange of movements, or dance.</p>


<p>The alphabetic aspects of the response involve moving and counting text:
command-c and command-v, over and over.  Quickly copying blog postings feels
mechanical until we realize that a point is being made by pasting together all
that text.  The spotlight highlights the word count as prose accumulates in the
document. There are many more possibilities in this space. For years, we've
known that digital texts differ from their analog equivalents in their fluidity, in the ease with which we
move and mix them. Their digital nature, Lev Manovich suggests, makes new media
texts numerical, modular, and ready for automation (27-32). Digital
representation, Wolfgang Ernst, argues "dissolves any semantically meaningful
archival unit into discrete blocks of signals" (60). This digital turn offers an
"epistemological revolution" (60) for Ernst and yields database logics for
Manovich based on "the ability of the computer to produce endless variations"
(236). Yet, here, we are simply moving large blocks of academic text. </p>

<p>
The
mixing, counting, and searching in <em>Waves</em> represents what Manovich considers
"low-level" implications of the shift in behaviors after digitization.
The autocomplete function simply searches the text document for words that match the
initial letters being typed and  inserts suggestions. Still, this low-level
shift is enough to recast interactions between humans and machines. At 05:00, the cursor is placed at the top
of the text editing document for improvisational typing. The live typing
continues until a breakdown develops [06:00] as the autocomplete function is
tried multiple times with the intent of completing the phrase “this is the place
where we make scholarly” with the term “waves.” Autocomplete fails to generate
the term, and a question is typed [06:09]: “where are the waves?” The phrase
“We seek w” is typed, and autocomplete is tried again, this time finding the
term “waves,” which has now been added to the document just three words away
[06:16].  So much of the
composition is driven by digital affordances--from copying to counting to
computer-composited layers of images, sounds, and texts. And yet the human hand
remains always in play, bringing the cursor back to the document and adding more
text for the digital searching routine to process. We find humans and machines performing together in the composing.</p>



<p>Ernst makes a distinction between humans and machines when discussing digital
logics, noting that, when comparing words, images, or sounds, "the difference
between aesthetic regimes exists only for the human user" as the computer
"calculates images, words, and sounds basically indifferently" (118-19). Since
these material aspects of digitality operate "at a level that is not
directly accessible to human senses" (60), the "physical layer below
symbolically expressed culture can be registered only by the media themselves"
(61), shifting us away from textual analysis and toward reading of artifacts and
machines. A reading for Ernst "concentrates on the nondiscursive elements . . .
not on speakers but rather on the agency of the machine" (45).</p>


<p>Beyond the material level of binary code, however, humans and machines
recombine, particularly through experiences of representation. Ernst asks us to
contemplate the reading (calculating and capturing) "that only computing can do"
(62) but allows that humans and machines will continue to mix through
representation that creates a synesthetic convergence. Though digital operations play
out "below the sensual thresholds of sight and sound," it's still possible that
"synesethetically, we might <em>see</em> a spectrographic image of a previously
recorded sound memory" (60). Thus, we can recognize the new materiality of
digital media with "analysis [that] opens culture to noncultural insights
without sacrificing the specific wonders of culture itself" (63).</p>

<p>For screen composing, the levels Ernst describes and the focus on media
objects translates into an invitation to play with combinations of machine- and
human-driven artifact-textuality. Framing media and digital materiality on their
own terms is complicated by the addition of representation. Ernst points out the
challenge of "[describing] the nondiscursive practices specified in the elements
of the technocultural archive without simply reducing the archive to its
technical apparatuses" (114-15). In practical terms, software and representation
are brought together through composing, since "in multimedia space, sound and
images can be shifted, cut, stored, and reloaded, as in word-processing
software" (121). As Erin Manning explains, "digital technologies must work at
the level of perceptual emergence" (72). Emergence is the key term here, as it
brings together "technogenetic" movements that blend the organic and technical.
Rather than working "prosthetically, technology must become capable of actively
<em>making</em> sense" (72). The sense that is created, like the human-computer
interaction in <em>Waves,</em> "interweaves the organic and the technogenetic"
(72).
