 <p>
    This video was created in 2012 as an informal piece of scholarly writing,
    occasioned by conversations that followed the posting of an opinion piece
    online by the <em>New York Times</em>. The piece, written by Stanley Fish,
    questioned tenets associated with digital humanities. A robust conversation
    followed in multiple academic blog postings. <em>Waves</em> fashions a
    similar response using video.
</p>
<p>
    The piece brings together two screen recordings. One includes a video of a
    live musical performance and captured browsing through a multimedia
    documentary about an abandoned town in Canada. This recording plays while a
    second films movement through a series of blog postings in web browser
    windows. The blog postings are copied into a text editing file where
    autocomplete and word counting tools are used to manipulate the text.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

 <p>
    00:00 A video hosted by YouTube with the title "Postcard from 1952 (Live)—
    Explosions in the Sky" appears in the upper left of the screen. In the
    upper right, a window with a video recording of a cursor typing text
    appears. The cursor clicks the play button on the YouTube clip, starting a
    live musical performance of the song "Postcard from 1952." Enthusiastic
    crowd noise is heard. The cursor clicks play on the video player in the
    upper right, and a recording of text being typed begins.
</p>
<p>
    00:20 A new web browser window appears showing a Twitter timeline. A
    spotlight illuminates the cursor, which scans over a tweet that reads
    "Anyone remember name of multimedia project from last year or so about
    abandoned/demolished town in alaska (I think)." Band banter and crowd noise
    is heard. The scrollbar is moved up in the Twitter timeline and a spotlight
    illuminates the cursor moving over another tweet, which reads "@iamdan Is
    this it Dan? Welcome to Pine Point (Canada, not Alaska):
    doclab.org/2010/Welcome-t. . ."
</p>
<p>
    00:33 A new web browser window appears, covering the whole screen. The
    window contains the results of a search for "welcome to pine point." A band
    member can be heard saying to the crowd, "It's a privilege to be in front
    of you. We are called Explosions in the Sky and we come from Texas." The
    cursor clicks on the link for the first search item and the web site
    pinepoint.nfb.ca with the title NFB—Welcome to Pine Point is loaded into
    the web browser, filling the background of the screen. A text editing
    window appears in the foreground, titled "printcentricity is sneaky." The
    file is empty. Buzzing bees can be heard. The sound of the live musical
    performance can be heard as the band begins to play.
</p>
<p>
    00:45 A new web browser window is opened, covering the text editing window
    and showing an article, titled "The Digital Humanities and the Transcending
    of Mortality —NYTimes.com." The cursor highlights the first sentence of the
    article: "This is a blog." The sound of someone speaking in a hoarse voice
    can be heard: "mouse click, tab, 579, click." A video player window showing
    blue sky and vapor trails appears on screen. A video player window showing
    an old man making enormous soap bubbles on a beach appears on screen. The
    cursor selects the text in the article. A dialog box opens, and Copy is
    selected. Someone speaking can be heard: "mouse click. Backspace 10." The
    cursor moves the browser window with the article offscreen.
</p>
<p>
    01:00 The browser window with the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project is
    brought to the front. A collage of hand-drawn images blended with old
    photographs fills the window. The text editor window is brought forward and
    moved to the top right of the screen. The cursor clicks in the text editor
    window, and then pastes text into the text file. Two videos, one showing a
    man blowing large bubbles and the other showing jet plane vapor trails in
    the sky, are brought forward. The cursor manipulates these various windows.
</p>
<p>
    01:18 A web browser window slides onto the screen. At the top is the
    heading, "Using BBAutoComplete." A spotlight appears, highlighting the
    cursor, which scans text reading: "type the first few letters of a long
    word in one of the supported applications . . . BBAutocomplete looks
    backwards from the current insertion point to the beginning of the document
    . . . Next it looks forwards." The "Using BBAutocomplete" browser window is
    minimized and slides off the screen. On screen, images (and sounds) from
    the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project and other media and browser
    windows intermingle.
</p>
<p>
    01:32 The text editor window is brought forward. A small text editor dialog
    box with the title, Scripts, appears. In the dialog box is a highlighted
    phrase (BBAutocomplete) with a keyboard shortcut next to it (command-/).
    The cursor is placed at the top of the text editor window and begins
    typing: "We seek c." The cursor moves down and selects a button in the
    Scripts dialog box that says Run. In the text editor window, the letter c
    is autocompleted to read "column." The button is clicked again and the word
becomes "clog." The cursor continues to type and play with the autocomplete function.
</p>
<p>
    01:59 The browser window with the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project
    fills with a white background over which an animated cutout of a bird moves
    from right to left in the lower portion of the screen. The text editing box
    and YouTube window with the band playing sporadically appear and disappear
    in front of the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> background. The sound of a
    bird chirping can be heard, mingled with soft organ sounds and the live
    musical performance.
</p>
<p>
    02:08 In the text box, the copied opening paragraph of the NYTimes.com
    article is visible: "This is a blog. There, I've said it. . . ." In the
    browser window with the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project, the
    animated bird grasps a piece of yarn in its beak and flies off, dragging
    new imagery onto the screen, including a scan of a flyer with a line
    drawing of a figure in a welder's mask. At the top of the scan is a label
    that reads: "Ads from Pine Point Yearbooks." In the text editor window, the
    cursor deletes text until the phrase, "We seek tr" remains. The run button
    for the Autocomplete script is clicked, and "tr" becomes "traditional." The
    Run button is clicked, and traditional becomes "transform." The cursor
begins typing, and transform become "transformation." From the    <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project, a voice begins to speak: "I don't
    think I've ever had closure with Pine Point. I always. I always feel sad
    when I, like you said, when I tell somebody I grew up in Pine Point and
    they ask me when do I come back. I go, Oh, it's not there anymore. And I do
    feel a sense of, I don't know what it is. For me it's weird to say that I
    don't have . . ."
</p>
<p>
    02:33 In the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> window, which constitutes the
    backdrop of the screen, imagery from an abandoned town and scraps of text
    from interviews appear. One passage reads: "When I look at people's faces
    in the old Pine Point photos, there's no sense of hesitation, no hint that
    they knew that one day this might all end." The scrollbar in the text
    editing window is moved to the bottom of the page. The Scripts dialog box
    for the text editor is replaced with an Info dialog box. The Info dialog
    box contains the name of the text file ("printcentricity is sneaky") and
    entries indicating number counts: "Chars 13,831; Words 2,218; Lines 27;
    Pages 0." The cursor turns into a spotlight, illuminating the four entries.
</p>
<p>
    02:55 A browser window is brought on screen. The window contains search
    results for "welcome to pine point" and has nine tabs with additional pages
    listed at the top. The cursor resizes the window and moves it to the lower
    right of the screen. The first of the nine tabs is clicked, and a web page
    is loaded into the browser window. In the body of the page, there is a blog
    posting. The text of the blog posting is selected, and copied. The cursor
    moves up and selects the text editor window. New text is pasted into the
    window. The text editor Info dialog box appears on screen. The cursor
    becomes a spotlight and illuminates the Info dialog box, which displays new
    numbers in each of the count fields: "Chars 22,199; Words 3,581; Lines 151;
    Pages 0." The <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> backdrop shows a grid of home
    videos and footage from the Canadian town.
</p>
<p>
    03:17 The cursor selects the second of the nine additional tabs in the
    browser window, and copies the text of the blog posting. The live musical
    performance continues to play. The sound of a small, two-stroke motor can
    be heard. The text editor window is brought forward, and new text is pasted
    into the window. The Info dialog box is brought on screen. The cursor turns
    into a spotlight and illuminates the changing word, character, and line
    counts. The cursor selects the third of the nine additional tabs, copies
    the text of the blog posting, and then pastes it into the text editor
    window. The Info dialog box appears and the cursor turns into a spotlight
    illuminating the changing counts. The sound of a small two-stroke engine
    continues as the hi-hat cymbal taps rhythmically in the musical
    performance.
</p>
<p>
    03:46 The fourth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The sound of the
    two-stroke engine fades out and a woman's voice is heard: "Good morning,
    Laurie, how are you?" A second voice is heard: "Good morning, I'm fine,
    thanks." The first voice begins to talk, "good," but the second voice
    continues before trailing off: "It's a very busy Thursday, and we'd like to
    thank all of the people of Pine Point." Their words are muffled by the
    cheering of the crowd in the video with the musical performance. The text
    of the blog posting is copied and pasted into the text editor; the changing
    counts are highlighted.
</p>
<p>
    03:59 The fifth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The text of the blog
    posting is copied. The sound of a small child can be heard. The second
    voice is heard: "I only wish we could stay till the end." New text is
    pasted into the text editor. The Info dialog box appears, shows new counts,
    then disappears. The first voice is heard: "Yes. How long have you been
    here in Pine Point, Laurie?" Second voice: "I came here on Labor Day
    weekend, 1970." First voice: "For heaven's sakes. That's a long time."
</p>
<p>
    04:13 The sixth of the nine browser tabs is clicked, its text copied, and
    then pasted into the text editor window. The Info box is highlighted with
    new counts: "Chars 48,564, Words 8,063, Lines 436, Pages 0." The video of
    vapor trails is just visible on the left side of the screen. The voices in
    the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project continue. Second voice: "Almost
    sixteen years." First voice: "Yeah. I know I've been very pleased with all
    your products and service. So I personally would want to thank you." Second
    voice: "Thank you very much, we appreciate that." First voice: "Okay, lots
    of luck." Second voice: "Okay, thanks." The seventh browser tab is
    selected, its text copied, and pasted into the text editor. The Info box is
    brought on screen: "Chars 73,231; Words 12,340; Lines 681; Pages 0."
</p>
<p>
    04:32 The eighth of the nine browser tabs is selected, text is copied, then
    pasted into the text editor. The Info box is brought on the screen: "Chars
77,317; Words 12,981; Lines 719; Pages 0." Coming from the    <em>Pine Point</em> project in the background, the two-stroke engine can be
    heard as images of people working and living in a snowy town appear. In the
    live musical performance, enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    04:42 The ninth browser tab is clicked. The text is copied, and then the
    window is moved off the screen. In the video player window showing typing,
    the words "Craft. Teaching. A child. Videos. Transfer" appear. The video
    with enormous bubbles is brought back on screen. The cursor moves to the
    text editor and pastes text into the file. The Info box is highlighted:
    "Chars 82,241; Words 13,759; Lines 757; Pages 0."
</p>
<p>
    04:57 The cursor clicks on the scrollbar in the text editor window and
    moves it to the top. At the top are the words, "We seek transformation."
    The word transformation is deleted, and "to be s" is typed. The text at top
    of the page now reads "We seek to be s." The Scripts dialog box of the text
    editor is brought on screen, and the Run button for the BBAutoComplete
    function is selected. The autocomplete function inserts the word "seek" at
    the end of the line. The button is pressed again: "seek" becomes "should."
    The Run button is selected multiple times: “should” becomes "sake," "sea,"
    "said," "shifts," "scholarly," "scholarship," "so," "several."
</p>
<p>
    05:20 The cursor at the top of the text editor flashes at the end of the
    phrase, "we seek to be several." The cursor begins typing: "things and we
    want to make things." The typing continues: "There are more than enough of
    the old things in place." The music performance gains more energy as the
    YouTube video shows the band members picking on electric guitars.
</p>
<p>
    05:40 On screen, imagery from the media windows appears: band members
    playing the live performance; large soap bubbles; sky with jet plane vapor
    trails; typing in a text editor. The sound of the musical performance can
    be heard. In the video player showing typing, words continue to appear:
    "Turning. Gone. Some point. California." In the text editor, the typing
    continues: "This is the place where we make scholarly w."
</p>
<p>
    06:00 The cursor clicks on the Run button in the Scripts window. In the
    text editor, "w" becomes "we." The button is clicked multiple times: "we"
    becomes "where," "want," "what," "with," "went," "who." The cursor deletes
    the word "who" and types, "where are the waves?"
</p>
<p>
    06:12 In the text editor, the cursor types: "We seek w." The cursor moves
    down to the Scripts dialog box and clicks Run. In the text editor, "w" is
    replaced with "waves." Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. Typing
    continues: "We have found them!!!!"
</p>
<p>
    06:29 On screen, imagery from the media windows appears: an old man making
    soap bubbles with two long sticks; sky and vapor trails. In the text
    editor, typing and the use of the autocomplete feature continues until a
    phrase is produced: "We feel them flowing through the screen." On screen in
    a video window, vapor trails are colored bright orange against a dark sky,
    resonating with a fire burning in the snow that is visible in the "Pine
    Point" project playing in the background. The large soap bubble in the
    video with the old man on the beach is awash in color.
</p>
<p>
    06:59 The cursor minimizes the text editor window. On screen, multiple
    videos play. In the upper right of the screen, the "Pine Point" project in
    the background shows a burning pile of debris. In the lower middle of the
    screen, a video player shows a plane from below against a blue sky trailing
    streaks of white vapor. The video in the lower left shows the old man
    blowing huge bubbles on the beach, then fades out. More words appear in the
    video with typing in the lower right: "Papers. Making. Ambient. Narratives.
    Tracks."
</p>
<p>
    07:11 A small video player window slides onto the bottom right of the
    screen showing a line of text that says, "Credit and Much Appreciation to."
    At the top is the title: "worried about rigor?.mov." The cursor selects the
    play button on the video, and a list of sources begins to scroll from right
    to left.
</p>
<p>
    07:21 The live musical performance can be heard reaching its climax. The
    crowd can be heard cheering. A browser window in the background is selected
    and the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project fills the screen. The cursor
    moves over the Pine Point project and selects a video thumbnail that shows
    a middle-aged man and woman in an office. The video begins playing and a
    woman's voice is heard: "Excuse me, doctor. You said you've been here since
    . . . you started coming here since when?" A cash register sound is heard.
    A second voice is heard: "1964." The first voice can be heard: "What about,
    we've got a couple of ladies here, a receptionist and a nurse. How about
    them. What will they be doing?"
</p>
<p>
    07:46 On screen, imagery from media windows appears: large soap bubbles;
    the band playing; vapor trials. The sounds of the musical performance
    concluding can be heard. Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. In the
    office video, only one smiling woman is visible, on the far left of the
    screen. The first voice continues: "Are they gonna be here same as you?"
    The second voice: "Oh, they're gonna be here for a long time." [The voice
    stretches out the word "long" and lightly chuckles when speaking.] A third
    voice is heard as the woman speaks: "I guess I'll probably be here till the
    summer sometime." The first voice is heard: "Till the summer, eh?" The
    third voice is heard: "Right." The first voice can be heard: "You're gonna,
    you're gonna be one of the ones that, ah, puts the lights out? [laughter]
    Me too." The crowd cheers in the musical performance video. The cursor
moves media windows off the screen until only the    <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> project is visible.
</p>
<p>
    08:13 The sound of laughter and the first voice can be heard: "I talked to
    Lynn. She's gonna be here, too, so there'll be three of us." Soft, steady
    organ notes are heard. The first voice can be heard: "Well, it's been very
    nice for you to give me the time, and, uh, thank you again." The cursor
    moves to the top of the web browser window with the "Pine Point" project
    and selects the back button. The video stops.
</p>

<button class="accordion">Materials/Sources</button> <div
class="panel">

<p>
    Key components of the project are blog postings used to compile the text
    that is manipulated on screen. A total of ten blog postings are included,
and the entire text of each posting is used. Another key piece is the    <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> media project. The project is included in
    all but thirty-six seconds of <em>Waves</em>, but it only makes up a
    portion of the whole experience, as the materials on screen at any given
    moment are layered together with other browser and media windows.
</p>
<p>
    Several videos and compilations are also included. A video with a live
    performance of the song "Postcard from 1952" is part of the audio track and
    plays continuously. At points in <em>Waves</em>, a video showing a captured
    performance of live typing appears. A compilation video that shows large
    soap bubbles, bees, and flowers appears in segments, as does a video with a
    variety of images showing jet plane vapor trails.

    Stanley Fish is well known for reader-response literary criticism,
    suggesting that we turn to communities of readers to sort out uncertainties
    as we interpret texts and discuss ideas. On January 9, 2012, his opinion
    piece, "The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality," was
    published online by the<em> New York Times</em>. Fish self-consciously
    identified the piece as a blog posting. In many ways, Fish was joining a
    community engaged with discussions of online research and writing. His
    piece, however, challenged the transformative potential of emerging methods
    of digital communication. In the days that followed, numerous reactions
    appeared on blogs. <em>Waves</em> is a speculative response to Fish and to
    those subsequent blog postings with a different take on all the heavy
    prose.

    The video brings together performance and digital composing, a link already
    recognized by writing scholars. Through networks, technologies, and tools,
    "performance comes to the fore" and creates combinations that "make writing
'go live' in more ways than ever before" (Fishman et al., 246).    <em>Waves</em> enacts this composer-technology connection through text
    manipulation (performative action) that brings the human hand and the
computer together. Performance also shares alt-scholarship impulses that resist closure and
    embrace the improvisational yes-and. Glenna Gerard suggests that "in a land
that delineates, separates, and chooses between alternatives, yes-and offers creative possibilities that
    depend on inclusion and collaboration" (339). The screen provides a rich
    space for performative combinations. And video scholarship embraces and
    amplifies those possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Anthropologist Dwight Conquergood calls for a performance that emphasizes
    "a decentering agency of movement, intervention, transformation, struggle,
    and change" (19). The performances in <em>Waves</em> seek these
    transformations by bringing together humans, networks, and software through
    activities of representation. An unseen mouse click brings a Twitter
    timeline on screen. A keyboard shortcut transforms the cursor into a
    spotlight. These interactions illuminate coemergence as the author and
    operating system compose. The author aims to create emphasis. Layers of
    hardware and software respond. We realize that a point is made by compiling all the prose. The cursor spotlight illuminates the word
    count. There
    are many more possibilities in this space.

    For years, we've known that digital texts differ from their analog
    equivalents in their fluidity, in the ease with which we move and mix them.
    Their nature, Lev Manovich suggests, makes new media texts numerical,
    modular, and ready for automation (27–32). Digital representation, Wolfgang
    Ernst says, "dissolves any semantically meaningful archival unit into
    discrete blocks of signals" (60). This digital turn offers an
"epistemological revolution" (60) for Ernst and yields database logics for Manovich based on "the
ability of the computer to produce endless variations" (236). In    <em>Waves</em>, we are simply moving large blocks of academic text. (And
    recasting those activities through images, sound, and motion.)

<aside class="pullquote-left">As long as the keyboards of computers are alphabet based like those of
    typewriters, the paradigm of printing remains dominant; progressively,
    though, the mouseclick is replacing the keystroke as the device for
    directing the monitor and the orientation is shifting to visually perceived
    information landscapes. <span class="attribution">Wolfgang Ernst, <span class="attribution-title">Digital Memory and the Archive</span> (121)</span></aside>
<p>
    Mixing, counting, and searching represent what Manovich considers
    "low-level" shifts in behaviors after digitization. The autocomplete
    function simply searches the text document for words that match the initial
    letters being typed and inserts suggestions. Still, this low-level shift
    shapes interactions. At 05:00, the cursor is placed at the top of the text
    editing document for improvisational typing. The live typing continues
    until a breakdown develops (06:00) as the autocomplete function can't
    complete the phrase "this is the place where we make scholarly" with the
    term "waves." Autocomplete fails, and a question is typed (06:09): "where
    are the waves?" The phrase, "We seek w" is typed, and autocomplete is tried
    again, this time finding "waves" right away, since it now sits just three
    words away (06:16). The composition is driven by digital affordances—from
    copying to counting to matching. At the same time, the cursor and keyboard
    remain in play to keep the performance going as the composer takes over to
    add some words.

    <em>Waves</em>
    includes aspects of the media project <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em>. That
    project opens with a question: "Imagine your hometown never changed . . .
    would it be so bad?" The imagery, sounds, and words threaded through the
    reflections on the town of Pine Point (which was planned, occupied for a
    generation, and then abandoned) blend with a sense of loss linked with
    print. Worries about words losing their power make sense. Narrative, Ernst
    says, "is being replaced by literally counting microevents on the
    media-archaeological level" (155). The new materiality of digital media
    offers a reading (calculating and capturing) "that only computing can do"
    (62). The concern is that the human is being replaced with the machine,
    that aesthetics, memory, perception, representation are becoming
    calculation. But words are here for good. <em>Waves</em> captures how
    scholarly responses (even in the blogosphere) are deeply rooted in print
    behaviors and how slow change happens. These resonances bring together a
    lost town with nostalgia for print and prose in a moment where words matter
    more than ever.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to words, Ernst tells us, "the difference between aesthetic
    regimes exists only for the human user," as the computer "calculates
    images, words, and sounds basically indifferently" (118–19). Since these
    material aspects of digitality operate "at a level that is not directly
    accessible to human senses" (60), the "physical layer below symbolically
    expressed culture can be registered only by the media themselves" (61).
    This shifts us away from textual analysis and toward artifacts and
    computers. A reading, for Ernst, "concentrates on the nondiscursive
    elements . . . not on speakers but rather on the agency of the machine"
    (45).
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the material level of binary code, at the same time, humans and
    machines recombine, particularly through representation. Though digital
    operations play out "below the sensual thresholds of sight and sound," it's
    still possible that "synesthetically, we might
    see a spectrographic image of a previously recorded sound memory" (60).
    When we drill down to the layers beneath the beautiful sights and sounds,
    humans and computers separate briefly, before coming together again. There
    is a threshold between human and machine. Yes. And still, somehow, they
    connect through composing.
</p>
<p>
    For screen composing, the convergent levels Ernst describes are an
invitation to experiment with combinations of machine- and human-driven artifact-textuality. Video scholarship deploys
    these materials through screen-based affordances (windows, mouse clicks,
    media, motion). In practical terms, software and representation are brought
    together, especially in moments of emergent composing where "sound and
    images can be shifted, cut, stored, and reloaded" (121). In these fluid,
    layered spaces, humans perform with machines to make meaning. As Erin
    Manning explains, "digital technologies must work at the level of
    perceptual emergence" (72). Emergence brings together "technogenetic"
    movements that blend the organic and technical. Rather than working
    "prosthetically, technology must become capable of actively making sense"
    (72). The sense that is created "interweaves the organic and the
    technogenetic" (72). The artifacts of screen performance in <em>Waves</em>
    become technogenetic markers of perceptual
    emergence as humans and machines compose together.
