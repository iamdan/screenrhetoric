<div class="panel">
<p>[00:00] The screen opens with a Safari web browser window with a YouTube video. The video occupies two thirds of the screen from the top-left. There is also a media player window filled with white occupying one third of the screen at the top-right. The cursor clicks the play button on the YouTube clip. The video reveals a live musical performance beginning. A title appears: Explosions in the Sky | Amos’ Southend | Charlotte, NC | April 3, 2011.
</p>
<p>[00:12] The cursor clicks play on the media player. The band welcomes the crowd and grabs their instruments. Enthusiastic crowd noise. In the top-third of the screen, the media window begins to show a video capture of someone typing. The text begins, “I feel silly talking. . . .”
</p>
<p>[00:20] A new Safari web browser window appears, occupying two-thirds of the screen near the top-right and layered on top of the other materials. The new browser window shows a Twitter timeline. A spotlight illuminates the cursor, which scans over a tweet. The tweet contains a profile thumbnail image of a white male in a Hawaiian shirt and the user name, iamdan Daniel Anderson. The tweet reads, “Anyone remember name of multimedia project from last year or so about abandoned/demolished town in Alaska (I think).” Band banter and crowd noise is heard.
</p>
<p>[00:25] The scrollbar is moved up in the Twitter timeline window, then the cursor highlights a tweet. The tweet contains a profile thumbnail image of a white male with sunglasses and the user name, mday666 Michael Day. A spotlight illuminates the cursor moving over the tweet, which reads, “@iamdan Is this it Dan? Welcome to Pine Point (Canada, not Alaska): doclab.org/2010/Welcome-t. . .”
</p>
<p>[00:33] A new Chrome web browser window appears, covering the whole screen. The window contains the result for a google search for “welcome to pine point.” The first item in the search results reads “Welcome to Pine Point: NFB pinepoint.nfb.ca/ Part book, part film, part family photo album, Welcome to Pine Point uncovers a place frozen in time and discovers what happens when an entire community is …” The cursor clicks on the link for the search item. In the video, the band leader says, “It’s a privilege to be in front of you. We are called Explosions in the Sky. And we are from Texas.” The crowd cheers. The web site pinepoint.nfb.ca/#/pinepoint with the title NFB – Welcome to Pine Point is loaded into the Chrome web browser filling the screen. A logo appears on screen that contains the letters ONF and NFB and an icon that combines the shape of a human and an eye.
</p>
<p>[00:39] The Safari browser windows are brought to the front of the screen, showing the YouTube clip playing and the Twitter timeline. The crowd cheers. A text editing window is opened, occupying a third of the screen in the middle on the right. At the top is the title, “printcentricity is sneaky.” The file is empty. Buzzing bees can be heard in the background. The band begins to play. A media window with a video is loaded and appears behind the text editing window. A patch of blue sky and player controls are visible, but the rest of the media window is covered by the text editor.
</p>
<p>[00:45] In the Chrome browser window layered beneath the other materials, the screen is filled with an image of an open field covered in grass. A new Safari browser window is opened. The title in the browser window is “The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality – NYTimes.com.” In the window on the left is a profile picture of an elderly white male and the text, “Stanley Fish on education, law and society,” and the title and text of an article. The cursor highlights the first sentence of the article: “This is a blog.” Audio begins to play: A slow keyboard melody. Someone speaking: “mouse click, tab, 579, click.” Two new videos appear on the screen: 1) a video showing blue sky and vapor trails (titled “this is not a blog post.mov”) and 2) a video of enormous soap bubbles on a beach. At the top of the bubbles video is the title, “words are not memories.mov.” The cursor moves the scrollbar in the Stanley Fish essay to the bottom of the article, then clicks on the text. The text of the article is selected. The “words are not memories.mov” bubbles video is moved to the bottom-right of the screen. The cursor clicks on the selected text in the Stanley Fish article. A dialog box opens and Copy is selected. Someone speaking: “mouseclick. Backspace 10.” The cursor clicks on a small button at the top of the Stanley Fish article browser window, which then shrinks and moves off the screen.
</p>
<p>[01:00] A red electic guitar appears in the video playing in the web browser window in the top-left of the screen. The guitar plays in the audio track (light, regular picking of strings). The audio from Welcome to Pinepoint plays in the background (steady organ sounds). Someone speaking: “backspace 10.” The text editing file and the video containing blue sky are moved simultaneously to the left, then separated. The title of the video with blue sky is now visible: “this is not a blog post.mov.” The Safari browser windows are hidden. The Chrome browser window fills the screen. It is partially covered by the text editor window toward the top-right quadrant of the screen. The Chrome browser window (with the Pinepoint project) contains a collage image that layers a painted rendering of mountains (top), trees (middle), and ground (front) over a photograph of a landscape with grass and sky. The collage image also contains cutouts of figures, a large American car from the 1070s, and a water tower. Over the image an “Intro” button appears in the lower left-hand corner along with links that read “Start Over |About This Project |Credits | Related NFB Films | Contact.” A button also appears on the right-hand side of the image that reads, “NEXT.”  The cursor clicks in the text editor window. A dialog box appears and Paste is selected. On the Chrome browser window, the NEXT button is clicked. Text is pasted into the text editor window.
</p>
<p>[01:04] The Chrome browser window beneath the videos and Safari windows is clicked and the Welcome to Pinepoint project fills all of the screen with the text editor window above. The Next button on the right side of the Pinepoint project is clicked. The image is replaced with a video depicting a plane flying over a landscape with grass, trees, and sky. The cursor moves the horizontal scrollbar in the text editor window to the left. The Safari window with the Explosions in the Sky live performance video clip is loaded back in the top-left third of the screen. A second guitar player is seated, steadily picking a dark-in-color guitar. The cursor moves the vertical scrollbar in the text editor window to the top. The “words are not memories” (bubbles) and “this is not a blog post” (blue sky) video windows are loaded back onto the screen.
</p>
<p>[01:11] The scrollbar in the text editor window (printcenricity is sneaky) is moved to the top. The cursor is placed at the top of the page, the pasted text of the Stanley Fish article is pushed down the screen two lines and the cursor placed at the top of the page. In the video with blue sky, vapor trails begin to appear. The minimize button on the blue sky and vapor trail video is clicked and the video slides down off the screen.
</p>
<p>[01:18] A safari browser window slides onto the screen. At the top is the heading Using BBAutoComplete. A spotlight appears highlighting the cursor, which scans text reading “type the first few letters of a long word in one of the supported applications. Behind the Safari browser window, the video of live, improvisational typing (Postcard from 1952.mov) is moved to the lower-middle of the screen. In the Safari browser window, the scrollbar on the Using BBAutocomplete page is pulled down and the spotlight illumnates text reading “BBAutocomplete looks backwards from the current insertion point to the beginning of the document.” The scrollbar is pulled down further and the cursor highlights: “Next it looks forwards.” The Using BBAutocomplete browser window is minimized and slides down off the screen. The Next button on the Pinepoint project beneath the other materials is clicked. The image in the background is replaced with a video of a camera moving over a street filled with cracks. In the cracks are occasional bunches of grass. Above the moving street in the top left the Explosions in the Sky live performance video has zoomed out and shows a player with a red guitar and in the distance a drummer (continued soft, steady picking of the guitar now with a second guitar also heard picking softly). The rest of the clip is covered by the text editor window.
</p>
<p>[01:32] The video with improvisational typing is minimized. A small text editor dialog box is brought onto the screen. At the top of the dialog box is written Scripts. In the box is a highlighted phrase (BBAutocomplete) with a keyboard shortcut next to it (command-/). The cursor is placed at the top of the printcentricity is sneaky text window. Letters begin to appear on the screen at the point of the cursor: “We seek c.” The cursor moves down and selects a button in the Scripts dialog box that says Run. In the text editor window, the letter c is autocompleted to read column. The button is clicked again and the word becomes clog.
</p>
<p>The video with improvisational typing is brought back on screen. The video shows words being typed: “I feel silly t.” The video is moved toward the top-right of the screen, hidden briefly behind the text editor window, then appearing with the typing continuing: “about alt.” In the Scripts dialog box, the run button is clicked again (clog becomes communal), and again (communal becomes challenge.) In the background the camera moves over the Pinepoint road. The sound of brakes squealing can be heard.
</p>
<p>[01:51] In the text editor window, the cursor is placed at the end of the word challenge, and then characters are deleted until only “ch” remains. In the background the Chrome browser with the Welcome to Pinepoint project is clicked, and the window moves in front of the live performance of Postcards from 1952 and the video with improvisational typing. A menu appears on the Pinepoint project with the items INTRO, TOWN, PINEPOINTERS, ENDS AND ODDS, COSMOS 954, HERE TO WORK, SHELF LIFE, WHAT’S WEIRD, REMAINS, AND ONE FOR THE ROAD. SHELF LIFE is clicked. The background is replaced with a screen beneath the text editor window, which covers all but the letters SHE. The image in the background slides to the left and another white screen appears. An animated cut out of a bird moves from right to left in the lower portion of the screen. Sound of a bird tweeting.
</p>
<p>[01:54] In the scripts dialog box, the Run button is clicked and “ch” becomes chief. The button is clicked again and chief becomes change. The cursor moves backwards deleting the word change and replacing it with a “t.” The live performance of Explosions in the Sky is brought back on screen (continued guitar, now with multiple guitars layering notes together). In the Scripts dialog cox, the run button is clicked again, again, and again and t becomes to, which becomes this, which becomes that. Bird chirping continues. Soft organ sounds continue.
</p>
<p>[02:08] In the background the animated bird grasps a piece of yarn in its beak and flies off. The white screen in the background is replaced with a scan of a flyer with a line drawing of a figure in a welder’s mask. At the top is a label that reads Ads from Pinepoint Yearbooks. In the text editor window, the cursor deletes text from the word that until only “t” remains, and then types an “r” to place “tr” before the cursor. The run button is clicked and “tr” becomes traditional. A voice begins to speak: “I don’t think I’ve ever had closure with Pinepoint. I always. I always feel sad when I, like you said, when I tell somebody I grew up in Pinepoint and they ask me when do I come back. I go, oh it’s not there any more.”
</p>
<p>[02:24] The voice continues: “And I do feel a sense of, I don’t know what it is.” The guitars from the Explosions in the Sky video begin a series of progressions to create a kind of rising and falling pattern. The voice from Pinepoint continues, and then fades out, “for me it’s weird to say that I don’t. . . .” In the Scripts dialog box for the text editor, the Run button is clicked and “traditional” becomes transform. The cursor at the end of transform begins typing and transform become transformation. The scrollbar in the text editing window is moved to the bottom of the page. The Scripts dialog box is moved off the screen to the left.  The Safari window with the Explosions in the Sky live performance is moved to the top-right area of the screen.
</p>
<p>[02:40] The video with improvisational typing (Postcard from 1952 Typing) is brought back on in the lower-middle of the screen. The video is partially covered by the text editor window. On multiple lines in the video text (sometimes partially covered) appears: “I like making / I feel silly / alt-scholarship / When I started out. . . . / There seemed to be a difference. . . . / An old man . . . making movies.” In the upper-right of the screen an Info dialog box for the text editor appears. The Info dialog box contains the name of the text file (“printcentricity is sneaky”) above four entries about the file and numbers indicating the count of each: Chars 13,831, Words 2,218, Lines 27, Pages 0. The cursor turns into a spotlight, illuminating the four entries. In the Chrome browser beneath the other windows, appear still images and blocks of descriptive text as well as a video on the left of the screen depicting a sunlit sidewalk with about eighteen inches of snow on the left side and a figure using a snow shovel. The scraping sounds of the snow shovel can be heard. The guitars continue their steady progressions. The Pinepoint organ continues playing long solemn notes.
</p>
<p>[02:50] The cursor clicks on the Pinepoint project in the background and it moves in front of the improvisational typing and Explosions in the Sky music performance videos. On the right-hand side of the Pinepoint project, the NEXT button is clicked. The background image is replaced with a plaque that is partially covered by the text editor window. Multiple plastic placards are screwed into the plaque, with more empty spots than full. The top Placard is partially covered and reads “T / SPOR.” Smaller placards below contain names: “Maria Lizotte 1980-81, Laurier Dragon 1981-82, Bill Burlington 1982-83.” A partially covered placard reads “Bernie 19.” There are nine additional empty placards. The NEXT button on the right-side of the Pinepoint project is clicked. Before the background can change, a Chrome browser window slides onto and covers the screen. The window contains search results for “welcome to pine point” and has nine tabs with additional pages listed at the top. The cursor selects the lower-right corner of the browser and resizes the window to fill about one quarter of the screen. Beneath the resized window, the plaque in the Pinepoint project has been replaced with a grid of thumbnail images representing archival videos. The guitar increase in pace and shift the melody of the progression of picked strings, which remains steady and sparse. The steady Pinepoint organ notes continue. The video depicting blue sky is brought back to the lower portion of the screen, just left of center. Across the blue sky a four engine jet leaves four white vapor trails. The Chrome window with search results and multiple tabs is moved to the lower-right of the screen. The first of the nine tabs is clicked and a web page is loaded into the browser window. In the body of the page there is a blog posting. The Safari window with the live performance of Explosions in the Sky is brought back and placed in the top-right of the screen.
</p>
<p>[03:05] In the Chrome browser window with the multiple tabs, the text of the blog posting is selected and the contents of the window turn blue. The cursor moves up and selects the text editor window. New text is pasted into the window and the cursor jumps to the bottom of the text. The text editor Info window appears on screen. Blue sky and planes with vapor trails continue to appear partially covered by other windows. The cursor becomes a spotlight. The spotlight illuminates that name at the end of the pasted text, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, and then  moves up to illuminate the Info window, which displays new numbers in each of the count fields: Chars 22,199; Words 3,581; Lines 151; Pages 0. The Info window is closed.
</p>
<p>[03:17] The cursor moves up and selects the second of the nine additional tabs in the Chrome browser window. A new page is loaded into the browser, with the body of the text already selected and highlighted in blue. Two cursors appear over the blue text. The browser window is scrolled up. One of the cursors turns into a spotlight. The other opens a dialog box anchored to the text. In the Dialog box the word Copy is selected and appears in blue. The cursor clicks on Copy and the dialog box disappears. The guitars and the organ play. In the Chrome browser in the background, the thumbnail videos in the Pinepoint project shift. A larger video showing cranes appears in the top-left. The sound of a small, two-stroke motor can be heard. The sound is not a roaring or high pitched motor, but a popping of exhaust and steady drum-like bubbling.
</p>
<p>[03:24] The cursor selects the text editor window (printcentricity is sneaky). New text is pasted into the window. The Info dialog box is brought on screen. The cursor turns into a spotlight and illuminates the dialog box. The cursor selects “OK” and the dialog box closes.

Regular sounds of a top-hat symbol can be heard. Organ sounds continue.
</p>
<p>[03:46] The fourth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The sound of the two-stroke engine fades out and a woman’s voice is heard: “Good morning, Laurie, how are you?” A second voice is heard: “I’m fine thanks.” The first voice begins to talk, “good,” but the second voice continues before trailing off: “It’s a very busy Thursday, and we’d like to thank all of the people of Pinepoint.” The text of the blog posting is copied. The Safari window with the live performance (Explosions in the Sky) is moved to the top-left portion of the screen. In the video, a drummer appears in close up. New text is pasted into the text editor. The sounds of the top-hat symbol are replaced with regular beats of bass and snare drums. Enthusiastic crowd sounds.

</p>
<p>[07:21] In the video in the upper-left of the screen, the frame is close on the player with the red guitar bobbing his head, then zooms out to show the player with the black guitar. The music is at full intensity. They both rapidly flash their hands and pick, and then stop. The ringing guitars trail off. Enthusiastic crowd sounds. The text in the video at the bottom-right of the screen begins to move from right to left and new text appears: “Welcome to Pine Point pinepoint.nfb.ca/.” High pitched cheering can be heard. Clapping. The players with the red and black guitars in the Explosions in the Sky video begin softly and sparsely picking their strings again. Organ sounds increase in presence. The Chrome browser window in the background is selected and the Welcome to Pinepoint project fills the screen. In the small video at the bottom (worried about rigor.mov) new text scrolls from right to left: “**** Explosions in the Sky, Postcard from 1952 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7UrcBN045k.” The bubbling sound of the two-stroke motor can be heard. Crowd sounds.
</p>
<p>[07:32] In the top-right portion of the Pinepoint project a small black strip of tape appears with words made by a label maker in white capital letters: VIDEOS TAKEN IN FINAL WEEK BY TED SHUTSA.” The cursor moves over the Pinepoint project and selects a video thumbnail that shows a middle-aged man and woman in an office. The video thumbnail expands and fills the lower-left quarter of the screen with a video. A woman’s voice is heard. (It sounds like the first voice from the segment earlier.) “Excuse me doctor. You said you’ve been here since. [A cash register sound is heard] You started coming here since when.” The Explosions in the Sky video is brought forward above the Pinepoint project and the players with the black and red guitars begin playing the progression of notes from the opening of the song. A second voice is heard: “1964.” The videos with waves, blue sky and vapor trails, and improvisational typing are brought back on screen. New text has been added to the improvisational typing: “Tracks. / What do you mean/?” The video of sky and vapor trails is moved to the top-right of the screen. In the small video at the bottom of the screen (“worried about rigor.mov”) new text scrolls from right to left: “**** The following blogs: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/ *****  http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/response-to-stanley-fish/.” In the video in the lower-left (“words are not memories.mov”) waves are replaced by bubbles on the beach, and then the video is moved to the lower-middle of the screen. The first voice can be heard: “What about, we’ve got a couple of ladies here, a receptionist and a nurse. How about them. What will they be doing?”
</p>
<p>[07:46] The video of the live performance in the top-left frames the player with the black guitar steadily working through the progression of notes. The first voice continues: “Are they gonna be here same as you?” The second voice can be heard: “Oh, they’re gonna be here for a long time [the voice stretches out the word “long” and lightly chuckles when speaking].” In the lower-left corner of the screen, the video from the Pinepoint project shows a woman laughing. A third voice is heard as the woman speaks: “I guess I’ll probably be here till the summer sometime.” The first voice is heard: “Till the summer, eh?” The third voice is heard: “Right.” In the small video at the bottom, new text scrolls from right to left: “http://www.theoreti.ca/?p=4187     ****
http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2012/01/10/the-author-is-human/    **** http://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/fish-wins-round-two/.”
</p>
<p>[08:01] The video of sky and vapor trails in the upper right (“this is not a blog post.mov”) shows a vivid orange swatch of vapor trail from below. In the video with improvisational typing in the lower-right, new text has been added: “Tracks?” / Connected tracks.” Enthusiastic crowd sounds. The first voice can be heard: “you’re gonna, you’re gonna be one of the ones that, ah, puts the lights out? [laughter] Me too.” In the upper-left, the players in the Explosions in the Sky video stop picking. The cursor grabs the volume slider on the video and fades out the sound. The video stops. The cursor moves up and clicks a small yellow button and the video slides off the screen. Steady organ sounds can be heard. In the video in the lower-middle of the screen, an old man makes enormous bubbles on the beach. In the small video at the bottom, new text scrolls from right to left: http://porsdam.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/stanley-fish-blogging-on-dh/  *****  https://plus.google.com/u/0/105473622219622697310/posts/UjuqxkZThkE n **** http://www.bogost.com/blog/this_is_a_blog_post_about_the.shtml     **** http://metalab.harvard.edu/2012/01/digital-humanities-and-the-merry-go-round-of-metacommentary/ **** http://www.michaeljkramer.net/issuesindigitalhistory/blog/?p=513.”
</p>
<p>[08:13] The sound of laughter and the first voice can be heard: “I talked to Lynn. She’s gonna be here too, so there’ll be three of us.” The cursor moves up and clicks a small yellow button at the top of the sky and vapor trails video. The video slides down off the screen. The cursor clicks the yellow button in the bubbles video, and it slides off the screen. The cursor clicks the yellow button in the improvisational typing video, and it slides off the screen. In the small video at the bottom, new text scrolls from right to left: “[URLs]” and then the video disappears from the screen. Soft, steady organ notes are heard. The first voice can be heard: “Well it’s been very nice for you to give me the time, and, uh, thank you again.” The cursor moves to the top of the Chrome browser window with the Pinepoint project and selects the Back button. The video stops.</p>

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>
<p>This piece makes transformative fair use of existing materials. A number of intellectual property questions can be explored by imagining this use in terms of the multiple factors that go into decisions about the use of materials in multimodal compositions.
</p>
<p>The central components of the project are the blog postings that are used to aggregate the text that is manipulated on screen. The initial blog posting in this chain was published by the New York Times [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/ ]. The entire text of this opinion piece is incorporated into the project.   A total of nine additional blog postings are included—Aside, The Digital Humanities and the Revenge of Authority, The Author Is Human, Fish wins round two, Stanley Fish blogging on DH, A Google + Posting, This is a Blog Post about the Digital Humanities, A now-deleted posting at Harvard’s Metalab, and Digital Humanities in the Age of Fluidity. Each of these articles or blog postings is used in their entirety. However, their full text never appears on screen. An initial, question, then, emerges regarding the amount of materials used. It is true that the entire text of these postings is needed to perform the machine-generated autocomplete activities that are captured in the video. At this point, we need to think through the difference between simply copying and displaying a whole text, and performing some kind of operation that renders the text in a new way. In this instance, a series of texts is aggregated into a single file, and then human and machine processes are used to identify and recopy very small, single-word segments of these texts to be incorporated into a new composition. This recopying has an element of randomness linked to the autocomplete tool. The new composition is a remix, nothing at all like the originals. Further, the remix is necessary to make a point; the mashing together, and then distillation of all that text conveys the message of printcentricity, making the use not only transformative but also critical.
</p>
<p>Another set of decisions relates to the use of the Welcome to Pine Point media project. The project is included in all but thirty-six seconds of the piece. And the Pine Point materials are a key piece of media at the conclusion of the piece. The Pine Point media project, however, is much richer than these excerpts. It’s hard to quantify its length, as sound, video, and multiple paths create an immersive mode of reading. This mode seems to call for more pathways for capturing and sharing reading, as we see with many game walkthroughs commonly found online. Here, Pine Point makes up a small portion of the whole experience, as the materials that are on screen at any given moment are layered together with browser and media windows, performances, and screen activities that make up the rest of the project. Whatever Pine Point materials are used are transformed by deep integration with a dozen other sources.
</p>
<p>The video with the live performance of Postcard from 1952 similarly is integrated with numerous other elements, and the visual elements are again covered, partial, or otherwise hidden. This item is deeply integrated and visually excerpted, but used in its entirety, and the audio track plays continuously. Here, we might also weigh the rhetorical integration with the use of materials. Both Pine Point and Postcard from 1952 evoke messages that resonate with the passing of time and a sense of loss. The materials are not random items that simply create a soundtrack or visual imagery, but choices meant to convey nostalgia in a mode that is more allusive than that of print scholarship.
</p>
<p>In any case, these materials are deeply integrated and linked with the argument of the text. Given that the U.S. Copyright office describes "transformative uses [as] those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work," the materials woven into the text seem to serve a transformative purpose. They evoke a sense of nostalgia that further the message about printcentric approaches to scholarly response.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The authoring and reading environments for interpretative scholarly work
are only just beginning to be designed in such a way that the linear, finite
conventions of print media can be changed for the constellationary, distributed,
multi-faceted modes of digital media. ~ Joanna Drucker, Humanities Approaches to Interface
Theory (2)</aside>

<p>This video has a lot of humans and machines performing together. An unseen mouseclick brings a Twitter timeline on screen; a keyboard shortcut transforms the cursor into a spotlight or brings up a dialog box with a word count. These human-computer interactions illuminate aspects of performan e from "mimesis [imitation] to poesis [construction] to kinesis [dynamism]" (Conquergood 18). Displaying the tweets yields imitation and representation as content is brought to the screen. At the same time, the move is visually kinetic. And the hand must click to bring the window on screen. And the layers of hardware and software respond to create a sweeping motion. The use of a cursor spotlight is both kinetic and productive as the circle of light moves and creates emphasis. The mouse and machine become a kind of pen to mark out meaning.  And the dynamism of this shared kinesis is transformative.  Conquergood calls for a performance that emphasizes "a decentering agency of movement, intervention, transformation, struggle, and change" (19). The point is that agency flows in these interactions, and both the human and machine exert their sway in the composing.
</p>
<p>The heart of the alphabetic aspects of the response involve moving and counting text. Cmd-c; cmd-v, over and over. For years, we've known that digital texts differ in their fluidity, in the ease with which we move and mix them. Quickly copying blog postings feels mechanical (with lots of input) until we realize that a point is being made by pasting together all that text.  The spotlight highlights that point: that's a lot of collected words; and there are many more possibilities in this space.  Their digital nature, Lev Manovich, suggests makes new media texts numerical, modular, and ready for automation (27-32). The  mixing, counting, and searching in "Waves" represents what Manovich considers "low-level" implications of this shift in textual behavior after digitization. BBAutocomplete simply searches the text document for words that match the initial letters being typed and  inserts suggestions. Still, this low-level shift is enough to recast interactions between humans and machines. At 06:08 seconds into the video, for instance, we reach the limits of the autocomplete feature's ability, as it is unable to generate the word "waves." So much of the composition is driven by digital affordances--from copying to counting to computer-generated layers of images, sounds, and texts. And yet the human hand remains always in play. The cursor returns to the document, adds more digital text, and then (by 06:18) the text generation can proceed.

<aside class="pullquote-left">Outsiders never see the long chain of small,
incremental ideas that lead to the final innovation . . . [and] don't notice the
many dead ends -- Keith Sawyer, Group Genius (14-16).</aside>

<p>In Group Genius, Keith Sawyer, details aspects of creative teams: "Individual creative actions take on meaning only later, after they are woven into other ideas, created by other actors" (15).  Sawyer is talking about humans, but the principle might also apply to this kind of human-computer interaction. Sawyer tells us, "in improvisational innovation, teams start with the details and then work up to the bigger picture (17) that "outsiders never see the long chain of small, incremental ideas that lead to the final innovation" (14), and that "when we look at an innovation after the fact, all we remember is the chain of good ideas that made it into the innovation; we don't notice the many dead ends (16).  Earlier drafts of the base layer included one such dead end, a video (titled Poscard from 1952 Ticker) compiled of quotations from Sawyer's book.
