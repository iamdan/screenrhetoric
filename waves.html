<button class="accordion">Transcript</button> <div class="panel"> <p>This video
brings together two screen recordings of performances with videos player and web
browser windows. On screen a number of videos play, including a video with a
live musical performance and a video that captures a multimedia documentary
about an abandonded town in Canada. These materials play while the cursor moves
through a series of blog postings in browser windows. The blog postings are copied into a text editing file, and autocomplete and word counting tools are used to manipulate the text.</p>



<p>[00:00] The screen opens with a Safari web browser window with a YouTube
  video and a video player window. The cursor clicks the play button on the YouTube clip. The video
  reveals a live musical performance beginning. A title appears: Explosions in
  the Sky | Amos’ Southend | Charlotte, NC | April 3, 2011. Enthusiastic crowd
  noise is heard. The cursor clicks play on the video player and the window fills with a recording of text being typed.” </p>

<p>[00:20] A new Safari web browser window appears showing a Twitter timeline. A spotlight illuminates the cursor,
which scans over a tweet that reads, “Anyone remember name of multimedia project from last year or so
about abandoned/demolished town in Alaska (I think).” Band banter and crowd
noise is heard.  The scrollbar is moved up in the Twitter timeline and a spotlight
illuminates the cursor moving over another tweet, which reads, “@iamdan Is this it
Dan? Welcome to Pine Point (Canada, not Alaska): doclab.org/2010/Welcome-t. . .”
</p>

<p>[00:33] A new Chrome web browser window appears, covering the whole screen.
The window contains the results for a google search for “welcome to pine point.”
The cursor clicks on the link for the first search item and the web site
pinepoint.nfb.ca/#/pinepoint with the title NFB – Welcome to Pine Point is
loaded into the Chrome web browser filling the screen.  A text editing window
appears on screen. At the top is the title, “printcentricity is sneaky.” The
file is empty. Buzzing bees can be heard in the background. The sound of the
live musical performance can be heard as the band begins to play.  </p>


<p>[00:45] A new Safari browser window is opened. The title in the browser
window is “The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality –
NYTimes.com.” and the browser window contains the text of an article. The cursor
highlights the first sentence of the article: “This is a blog.” The sound of
someone speaking can be heard: “mouse click, tab, 579, click.” A video player
window showing blue sky and vapor trails appears on screen. A video player
window showing enormous soap bubbles on a beach appears on screen. The cursor
selects the text in the article. A dialog box opens and Copy is selected.
Someone speaking can be heard: “mouseclick. Backspace 10.” The cursor moves the
browser window with the article off screen. </p>

<p>[01:00] The Chrome browser window with the Welcome to Pinepoint project is
brought to the front of the screen. The text editor window is brought to the
top-right quadrant of the screen. The cursor clicks in the text editor window.
Text is pasted into the text editor window. The cursor manipulates the various windows on screen.</p>


<p>[01:18] A safari browser window slides onto the screen. At the top is the
heading Using BBAutoComplete. A spotlight appears highlighting the cursor, which
scans text reading “type the first few letters of a long word in one of the
supported applications. BBAutocomplete looks backwards from the current
insertion point to the beginning of the document. Next it looks forwards.” The
Using BBAutocomplete browser window is minimized and slides down off the screen.
On screen images from the media and browser windows appear. The live performance
and  sounds from the media clips can be heard. </p>


<p>[01:32] The text editor window is brought on screen. A small text editor
dialog box appears. In the dialog box is a highlighted phrase (BBAutocomplete)
with a keyboard shortcut next to it (command-/). The cursor is placed at the top
of the text editor window and begins typing. The typing stops and the cursor
selects "Run" in the autocomplete dialog box. In the text editor window, the
cursor continues to type and select the autocomplete function.</p>



<p>[01:59] On screen, the Chrome browser window with the welcome to Pinepoint
project fills with a white background over which an animated cut out of a bird
moves from right to left in the lower portion of the screen. The sound of a bird
chirping can be heard. The sounds from the live musical
performance can be heard. Soft organ
sounds can be heard. </p>

<p>[02:08] In the Chrome browser window with the welcome to Pinepoint project,
the animated bird grasps a piece of yarn in its beak and flies off. A voice
begins to speak: “I don’t think I’ve ever had closure with Pinepoint. I always.
I always feel sad when I, like you said, when I tell somebody I grew up in
Pinepoint and they ask me when do I come back. I go, oh it’s not there any more.
And I do feel a sense of, I don’t know what it is. For me it’s weird to say that I don’t. . . .”

[02:33] In the Chrome browser window imagery from the welcome to Pinepoint
project appears. The scrollbar in the text editing window is moved to the bottom
of the page. The Scripts dialog box for the text editor is replaced with an Info dialog
box. The Info dialog box contains the name of the
text file (“printcentricity is sneaky”)  and
entries indicating number counts: Chars 13,831, Words 2,218, Lines 27, Pages
0. The cursor turns into a spotlight, illuminating the four entries.  </p>


<p>[02:55]  A Chrome browser window is brought on screen. The window contains
search results for “welcome to pine point” and has nine tabs with additional
pages listed at the top. The cursor resizes the window and moves it to the
lower-right of the screen. The first of the nine tabs is clicked and a web page
is loaded into the browser window. In the body of the page there is a blog
posting. The text of the blog posting is selected. The cursor moves up and
selects the text editor window. New text is pasted into the window. The text editor Info dialog box appears on
screen. The cursor becomes a spotlight and illuminates the Info dialog box, which displays new numbers in each
of the count fields: Chars 22,199; Words 3,581; Lines 151; Pages 0. </p>


<p>[03:17] The cursor selects the second of the nine additional tabs in the
Chrome browser window. A new page is loaded into the browser. The cursor copies
the text of the blog posting. The sound of the live musical performance can be
heard. The sound of a small, two-stroke motor can be heard. The text editor
window is brought forward and new text is pasted into the window. The Info
dialog box is brought on screen. The cursor turns into a spotlight and
illuminates the dialog box. The cursor returns to the Chrome browser window and
selects the third of the nine additional tabs, copies the text of the blog
posting, and then pastes it into the text editor window. The Info
dialog box appears and the cursor turns into a spotlight illuminating the
changing word, character, and line counts. The sound of a small two-stroke
engine continues.  </p>

<p>[03:46] The fourth of the nine browser tabs is clicked. The sound of the
two-stroke engine fades out and a woman’s voice is heard: “Good morning, Laurie,
how are you?” A second voice is heard: “I’m fine thanks.” The first voice begins
to talk, “good,” but the second voice continues before trailing off: “It’s a
very busy Thursday, and we’d like to thank all of the people of Pinepoint.” The
text of the blog posting is copied, and then pasted into the text editor. The Info dialog box appears on the
screen and the changing word count is highlighted.  </p>

<p>[03:59] The fifth of the nine
browser tabs is clicked. The text of the blog posting is copied. The sound of a
small child can be heard. The second voice is heard: “I only wish
we could stay till the end.” New text is pasted into the text editor. The Info
dialog box appears, shows new counts, then disappears. The first voice is heard: “Yes, how
long have you been here in Pinepoint, Laurie?” Second voice: I came here Labor
Day weekend 1970.”  First voice:
“For heaven’s sakes. That’s a long time.”  </p>

<p>[04:13] The sixth of the nine browser tabs is clicked, and its text is
copied. New text is pasted into the text editor window. The info box is brought
on screen with new counts: Chars 48,564, Words 8,063, Lines 436, Pages 0.  The
voices in the Pinepoint project continue. Second voice: “Almost sixteen years.”
First voice: “Yeah. I know I’ve been very pleased with all your products and
service. So I personally would want to thank you.” Second voice: “Thank you very
much we appreciate that.” First voice: “Okay, lots of luck.” Second voice: “Okay
thanks.” The seventh browser tab is selected, and text is copied, then pasted
into the text editor. The Info box is brought on screen: Chars 73,231; Words
12,340; Lines 681; Pages 0.  </p>


<p>[04:32] The eighth of the nine browser tabs is selected, text is copied, then
pasted into the text editor.  The Info box is
brought on the screen: Chars 77,317; Words 12,981; Lines 719; Pages 0. In the
Pinepoint project in the background, the two-stroke engine can be heard. In the live musical performance, enthusiastic
crowd sounds can be heard. </p>


<p>[04:42] The ninth browser tab is clicked. The text is copied, and then the
window is moved off the screen. The video with enormous bubbles (words are not
memories.mov) is brought back on screen.  Text is pasted into the text editor. T
The Info box appears. The cursor turns into a spotlight: Chars 82,241; Words
13,759; Lines 757; Pages 0. </p>


<p>[04:57] The cursor clicks on the scrollbar in the text editor window and
moves it to the top. At the top are the words, We seek transformation. The word
transformation is  deleted. The Scripts dialog box of the text editor is brought
on screen. The cursor begins typing and selecting the Run button for the
BBAutoComplete function. The autocomplete function inserts the word "seek" at
the end of the line. The button is pressed again: seek becomes should.  In the
Scripts window, the Run button is selected multiple times: should becomes sake;
sea; said; shifts; scholarly; scholarship; so; several. </p>

<p>[05:20] The cursor at the top of the text editor flashes at the end of the
phrase, “we seek to be several.” The cursor begins typing: “things and we want
to make things.” The typing continues: “There are
more than enough of the old things in place.” </p>

<p>[05:40] On screen imagery from the media windows appears: band members
playing the live performance; large soap bubbles; sky with jet plane vapor
trails. The sound of the musical performance can be heard. In the text editor,
the typing continues: “This is the place where we make scholarly w.” </p>

<p>[06:00] The cursor clicks on the Run button in the Scripts window. In the
text editor, “w” becomes we. The button is clicked multiple times: we becomes
where; want; what; with; went; who. The cursor deletes the word, who, and types,
“where are the waves?”  </p>

<p>[06:12] In the text editor, the cursor types: “We seek w.” The cursor moves
down to the Scripts dialog box and clicks Run. In the text editor, “w” is
replaced with “waves.” Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. Typing continues: “We have
found them!!!!” </p>

<p>[06:29] On screen imagery from the media windows appears: an old man making
soap bubbles with two long sticks; sky and vapor trails  In the text editor,
typing and the use of the autocomplete feature continues until a phrase is
produced: “We feel them flowing through the screen.” </p>


<p>[06:59] The cursor moves to the
top of the text editor window and clicks on a small yellow button. The text
editor slides off the screen. On screen, imagery from media windows appears. In the upper-right of the screen the Pinepoint
project in the background shows a burning pile of debris. In the lower-middle of
the screen the video shows a plane from below against a blue sky trailing
streaks of white vapor. In the video in the lower-left, the old man blows
bubbles on the beach. </p>

<p>[07:11] A small video player window slides onto the bottom-right of screen
showing a line of text that says, “Credit and Much Appreciation to." At the top
is the title: “worried about rigor?.mov.” The cursor selects the play button on
the video and a list of sources begins to scroll from right to left.
 </p>

<p>[07:21] The sounds of the live musical performance  can be heard.
The crowd cheers. A Chrome browser window in the background is selected and the
Welcome to Pinepoint project fills the screen. The cursor moves over the
Pinepoint project and selects a video thumbnail that shows a middle-aged man and
woman in an office. The video begins playing and a  woman’s voice is heard.  “Excuse me doctor. You
said you’ve been here since. [A cash register sound is heard] You started coming
here since when?”  A second voice is heard:
“1964.”  The
first voice can be heard: “What about, we’ve got a couple of ladies here, a
receptionist and a nurse. How about them. What will they be doing?” </p>

<p>[07:46] On screen imagery from media windows appears: large soap bubbles; the
band playing; vapor trials. The sounds of the musical performance concluding can
be heard. Enthusiastic crowd sounds can be heard. The first voice continues: “Are they gonna be here same as you?” The
second voice: “Oh, they’re gonna be here for a long time [the voice
stretches out the word “long” and lightly chuckles when speaking].” A third voice is heard as the woman speaks: “I guess I’ll
probably be here till the summer sometime.” The first voice is heard: “Till the
summer, eh?” The third voice is heard: “Right.”  The first voice can be
heard: “you’re gonna, you’re gonna be one of the ones that, ah, puts the lights
out? [laughter] Me too.” The cursor moves media windows off the screen</p>

<p>[08:13] The sound of laughter and the first voice can be heard: “I talked to
Lynn. She’s gonna be here too, so there’ll be three of us.”  Soft, steady organ notes are heard. The first
voice can be heard: “Well it’s been very nice for you to give me the time, and,
uh, thank you again.” The cursor moves to the top of the Chrome browser window
with the Pinepoint project and selects the Back button. The video stops.</p>

  <p>The central components of the project are the blog postings that are used
  to compile the text that is manipulated on screen.   A
  total of ten blog postings are included, and the entire text of each posting is used. Another key piece in the video is the <em>Welcome to Pine Point</em> media
  project. The project is included in all but thirty-six seconds of the piece, but makes up a small portion
  of the whole experience, as the materials that are on screen at any given
  moment are layered together with browser and media windows.</p>

  <p>Several videos and compilations are also included. A video with a live
  performance of the song, "Postcard from 1952," is woven into the audio track
  and plays continuously.  Both Pine Point and Postcard from 1952 evoke messages
  that resonate with the passing of time and a sense of loss. The materials are
  meant to convey nostalgia in a mode that is more allusive than that of print
  scholarship. </p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The authoring and reading environments for interpretative scholarly work
are only just beginning to be designed in such a way that the linear, finite
conventions of print media can be changed for the constellationary, distributed,
multi-faceted modes of digital media. <span class="attribution">Joanna Drucker, "Humanities Approaches to Interface
Theory" (2)</span></aside>

<p>On January 9th, 2012, Stanley Fish published an opinion piece in <i>The New York
Times</i> that self-consciously identified itself as a blog posting and challenged
the transformative potential of the digital humanities. In the days that
followed, countless responses were posted on blogs. <i>Waves</i> is a speculative test
of what a response to Fish and to those subsequent blog postings might look like in
video form. The video was made through a process of live capturing of screen
activities (with minor post-capture editing to add a list of sources). This
process was used twice, once to capture a base layer that includes the media
elements of the video and a second time to capture activities performed with
blog postings and a text editor. The video was posted to Vimeo on January 23rd, 2012.</p>

<p>This video features humans and machines performing together. An unseen
mouseclick brings a Twitter timeline on screen. A keyboard shortcut transforms
the cursor into a spotlight or brings up a dialog box with a word count. These
human-computer interactions illuminate co-emergence as software is used to
compose and the author and operating system mix.  The creation is kinetic and
linked with the body. The hand must click to bring forth the window. On screen,
layers of hardware and software respond to create meaning. The use of
a cursor spotlight focuses attention, as the circle of light moves and creates
emphasis. The mouse and machine mark out meaning through a kind of movement.
Dwight Conquergood calls for a performance that emphasizes "a decentering agency
of movement, intervention, transformation, struggle, and change" (19). The
performances in <em>Waves</em> seek these transformations by bringing together humans,
networks, and software through activities of representation. </p>

<p>The alphabetic aspects of the response involve moving and counting text.
Command-c and command-v, over and over.  Quickly copying blog postings feels
mechanical until we realize that a point is being made by pasting together all
that text.  The spotlight highlights the word count as prose accumulates in the
document. There are many more possibilities in this space. For years, we've
known that digital texts differ in their fluidity, in the ease with which we
move and mix them. Their digital nature, Lev Manovich, suggests makes new media
texts numerical, modular, and ready for automation (27-32). Digital
representation, Wolfgang Ernst, argues "dissolves any semantically meaningful
archival unit into discrete blocks of signals" (60). This digital turn offers an
"epistemological revolution" (60) for Ernst and yields database logics for
Manovich based on "the ability of the computer to produce endless variations"
(236). Yet, here, we are simply moving large blocks of academic text. </p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">As long as the keyboards of computers are alphabet
based like those of typewriters, the paradigm of printing remains dominant;
progressively, though, the mouseclick is replacing the keystroke as the device
for directing the monitor and the orientation is shifting to visually perceived
information landscapes. <span class="attribution">Wolfgang Ernst, <strong>Digital Memory and the Archive</strong> 121</span></aside>
<p>
The
mixing, counting, and searching in <em>Waves</em> represents what Manovich considers
"low-level" implications of the shift in behaviors after digitization.
The autocomplete function simply searches the text document for words that match the
initial letters being typed and  inserts suggestions. Still, this low-level
shift is enough to recast interactions between humans and machines. At 05:00, the cursor is placed at the top
of the text editing document for improvisational typing. The live typing
continues until a breakdown develops [06:00] as the autocomplete function is
tried multiple times with the intent of completing the phrase “this is the place
where we make scholarly” with the term “waves.” Autocomplete fails to generate
the term, and a question is typed [06:09]: “where are the waves?” The phrase
“We seek w” is typed, and autocomplete is tried again, this time finding the
term “waves,” which has now been added to the document just three words away
[06:16].  So much of the
composition is driven by digital affordances--from copying to counting to
computer-generated layers of images, sounds, and texts. And yet the human hand
remains always in play, bringing the cursor back to the document and adding more
text for the digital searching routine to process. We find humans and machines performing together in the composing.</p>



<p>Ernst makes a distinction between humans and machines when discussing digital
logics, noting that, when comparing words, images, or sounds, "the difference
between aesthetic regimes exists only for the human user" (118) as the computer
"calculates images, words, and sounds basically indifferently" (118-19). Since
these material-level aspects of digitality operate "at a level that is not
directly accessible to human senses" (60), the "physical layer below
symbolically expressed culture can be registered only by the media themselves"
(61), shifting us away from textual analysis and toward reading of artifacts and
machines. A reading for Ernst "concentrates on the nondiscursive elements . . .
not on speakers but rather on the agency of the machine" (45).


Beyond the material level of binary code, however, humans and machines
recombine, particularly through experiences of representation. Ernst asks us to
contemplate the reading (calculating and capturing) "that only computing can do"
(62) but allows that humans and machines will continue to mix through
representation that creates a synesthetic convergence. Though digital operations play
out "below the sensual thresholds of sight and sound," it's still possible that
"synesetheically, we might <em>see</em> a spectographic image of a previously
recorded sound memory" (60). Thus, we can recognize the new materiality of
digital media with "analysis [that] opens culture to noncultural insights
without sacrificing the specific wonders of culture itself" (63).</p>

<p>For screen composing, the levels Ernst describes and the focus on media
objects translates into an invitation to play with combinations of machine- and human-driven artifact-textuality. Framing media
and digital materiality on their own terms is complicated as representation is
added. Ernst notes the need to "[describe] the nondiscursive practices specified
in the elements of the technocultural archive without simply reducing the
archive to its technical apparatuses" (114-15). In practical terms, software and
representation are brought together through composing, since "in multimedia
space, sound and images can be shifted, cut, stored, and reloaded, as in
word-processing software" (121). As Erin Manning explains, "digital technologies
must work at the level of perceptual emergence" (72). Emergence is the key term
here, as it brings together "technogenetic" movements that blend the organic and
technical. Rather than working "prosthetically, technology must become capable
of actively <em>making</em> sense" (72). The sense that is created, like the
human-computer interaction in <i>Waves,</i> "interweaves the organic and the
technogenetic" (72).
