    This video was developed as a presentation for the 2016 Computers and
    Writing Conference. It opens with a number of screens showing citations
    from articles that raise questions about traditional methods of scholarly
    criticism. It also explores the poem "A Blessing" by James Wright. The
    video offers a survey of issues associated with scholarship and media
    composing, and then an embodied response to "A Blessing" in the form of a
    song.
</p>
<p>
    This video is somewhat traditional in the way it brings together quotations
    and narration to discuss alternative scholarship. The opening segments
    feature scholarly excerpts displayed on screen. The piece also includes
    aspects of process narrative or artist statement when the making of the
    video is discussed. The second half of the piece veers away from familiar
    response as the song performs an interpretation of Wright's poem.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

  <p>
    00:00 The video opens with a title screen: "The Blessing of Rescuing
    Critique, Daniel Anderson, @iamdan." A quotation appears on screen:
    "Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set
    equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness;
    guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission;
    superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than distraction;
    exposure rather than tact. . . . The danger . . . is less its potential
    brutality than the threat of banality (Rita Felski, 'Suspicious Minds')."
    Imagery of wild horses appears in the lower portion of the video,
    accompanied by soft, western-themed music. The narrator speaks: "In this
    piece, I show how multimedia invites us to move from concrete to abstract,
    opening avenues for emergent interpretation. I also experiment with a mode
    of response that recognizes some of the limits of critique and closure.
    Critique can be competitive, exclusionary, banal. Closure can lead us to
    overlook the generosity of the world around us, including the world of the
    texts that we study."
</p>
<p>
    00:37<strong> </strong>The text of the poem "A Blessing" begins scrolling
    on the lower half of the screen beneath another quotation that reads: "What
    drives [a hermeneutics of suspicion] is the conviction that appearances are
    deceptive, that texts do not gracefully relinquish their meanings, that
    manifest content shrouds darker, more unpalatable truths. It is a mode of
    interpretation that adopts a distrustful attitude toward texts in order to
    draw out meanings or implications that are not intended and that remain
    inaccessible to their authors as well as to ordinary readers (Rita Felski,
    explicating Ricoeur in 'Suspicious Minds')." The narrator speaks:
    "Practicing a mode of alt-scholarship, I created a response to this poem
    scrolling on the screen: 'A Blessing,' by James Wright. The poem is set off
    a rural highway near Rochester, Minnesota. It is about two companions who
    stumble across a pair of horses in a meadow. The poem suggests a bond
    between human and animal and among humans, an emotional connection."
</p>
<p>
    01:04 A new quotation appears in the top half of the screen: "Such an
    orientation has clear affinities with the burgeoning interest in affect.
    One of the distinguishing marks of works of art, after all, is their
    ability to inspire intense responses, inchoate emotions, quasi-visceral
    passions, working and worming their way into our minds and bodies. Art is
    the quintessential mood-altering substance. (Rita Felski, 'After
    Suspicion')." The Wright poem continues to scroll in the lower left: "We
    step over the barbed wire into the pasture." The narrator continues: "This
    emotional connection is often lost among the logic of academic closure. But
    affect is linked to abstraction and audio-visual registers, which makes
    multimodal production a space for emergent composing. The works we study
    are rich and ambiguous, unfolding like flowers. Why not our responses?"
</p>
<p>
    01:28 A new quotation appears at the top of the screen: "A critical inquiry
    involves some manner of courage or audacity. It is also why such a critical
    practice opens up a new possibility for elaborating the subject or what
    [Foucault] sometimes calls creating a new subjectivity, one that would by
    definition maintain an uncertain relation to existing terms of legitimacy
    and intelligibility, at least at first. (Judith Butler, 'Critique, Dissent,
    Disciplinarity')." In the lower portion of the screen, the poem continues
    scrolling: "For she has walked over to me / And nuzzled my left hand." The
    narrator continues: "These kinds of responses can create new
    subjectivities. 'A Blessing' depicts a coming-together as the speaker and
    his companion connect with 'two Indian ponies.'"
</p>
<p>
    01:38 A new quotation appears at the top of the screen: "The object of
    study is no longer an object. A generous reading is always, in part, a
    reading of ourselves reading. The thought it produces is never
    transferable, recognizable, paraphrasable, applicable, expoundable, or
    illustratable—meaning that it cannot be detached either from the text
    itself or from the moment of reading. (Timothy Bewes, 'Reading with the
    Grain')." The narrator continues: "And the poem extends that human-animal
    connection with a metaphor that transcends the subject/object divide and
    generates a new sense of self, at one with the world. "Suddenly I realize /
    That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into blossom." (This
    spoken quote corresponds with the scrolling text of the poem.)
</p>
<p>
    02:00 On screen, a folder displays a number of video files with timestamps
    from December 17, 2015. The narrator speaks: "On a Thursday morning, I
    worked up a response that plays with layering, cameras, and screens."
</p>
<p>
    02:08 Imagery of wild horses appears on screen, accompanied by the soft
    western music from the opening sequence. The narrator continues: "I started
    with a YouTube clip that depicts horses. I began bringing together verbal
    and visual representations; the literal associations translated into mostly
    corresponding moving images. I then used my laptop camera and Photo Booth
    to film an adaptation."
</p>
<p>
    02:22 On screen, a red guitar held in someone's lap fills the screen. A
    hand begins strumming the guitar.
</p>
<p>
    02:33 The volume level of the guitar strumming is lowered. The narrator
    speaks: "Here, we have a typical instance of a camera filming a subject,
    with the added layering of a reflection of the laptop on the surface of the
    guitar."
</p>
<p>
    02:46 The guitar strumming fades out. The narrator continues: "At the same
    time I used Snapz to capture the Photo Booth application recording on the
    screen. I used a transparency application to layer the YouTube video over
    the Photo Booth application as it filmed the guitar. Snapz captured a
    composite of Photo Booth filming and the YouTube video playing."
</p>
<p>
    03:03 On screen, a composite image shows a red guitar and images of wild
    horses on a laptop screen. The words "this machine performs critique with
    compassion" are visible as the desktop background. A hand begins strumming
    the guitar.
</p>
<p>
    03:11 The sound of the guitar fades out. The narrator continues: "I next
    turned on a visualizer and captured a clip with singing."
</p>
<p>
    03:17 On screen, an image of a sound visualizer color bar appears. The
    narrator sings the phrase "the greener grass starts at the edge of town."
    The colors in the color bar shift and spike in time with the singing.
</p>
<p>
    03:25 The color bar on the screen is replaced by the composite image of the
    guitar and horses. The narrator continues: "I also captured a scrolling
    video of the text of the poem. I brought all these materials into a video
    editor, made a few adjustments, and uploaded my response to YouTube. The
    process compressed a couple of hours and several captures into a
    three-and-a-half minute video that interprets the poem through creative
    response."
</p>
<p>
    03:44 The same composite images, this time framed in a video hosted on
    YouTube, appear. A hand begins strumming the guitar. The narrator sings the
    phrase "the greener grass starts at the edge of town."
</p>
<p>
    04:00 The music fades out. The imagery on the screen fades out leaving a
    white screen, which is quickly replaced with a close-up image of a man's
    face. The man's expression is distressed. The narrator speaks: "I enjoyed
    mixing horse imagery with music as a response to the poem, but was not
    satisfied. I wanted a response driven more by affect and companionship,
    something more abstract."
</p>
<p>
    04:13 On screen, a video is projected on a wall in a dark room. The video
    depicts drag racers and is sporadically paused and fast-forwarded. Segments
    of the video's subtitles are occasionally visible. The narrator continues:
    "I started over with this footage of drag racer Don Prudhomme, captured
    just after his competitor's car broke into pieces at over 200 miles per
    hour. Fortunately, the other racer was okay, but Prudhomme did not know
    this at the moment. I combined this clip with segments of another video
    depicting the early days of drag racing, a time that featured what might be
    called a cherished rivalry between Prudhomme and fellow racer Tom McEwen.
    The original translation with horses was too literal—horse reference to
    horse image. I wanted to feel and share the generative compassion in the
    poem. Taking another tack, I created this experiment in affective
    response."
</p>
<p>
    05:00 On screen, the narrator sits down in front of the projected video.
    The narrator is holding a red guitar and wears a white shirt. The images of
    drag racers are now projected on the shirt of the narrator. The dialogue
    accompanying the drag racing video is audible, but soft. The text of the
    poem "A Blessing" begins scrolling on screen. A small window showing the
    narrator singing and playing guitar filmed from a different angle is
    visible in the bottom right corner. The narrator begins playing the guitar.
</p>
<p>
    05:20 The narrator begins singing:
</p>
<p>
    The greener grass starts at the edge of town
</p>
<p>
    And there you'll find a wooden house with windows wide and porch steps
    leading down
</p>
<p>
    To a meadow before evening casting dust specks in the sunbeams all around
</p>
<p>
    As by the willow tree you walk pulled forward by the crickets' talk and the
    water sound
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your fields are full of horses in the grasses
</p>
<p>
    You step a little closer as each tender moment passes
</p>
<p>
    You know their skin is breathing and the dust smells of forever
</p>
<p>
    You start to think of leaving but you know that you will never
</p>
<p>
    06:26 On screen, imagery of two drag racers walking together appears. The
    narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>
    And turning from the road two silhouettes in soft shadow against the sky
</p>
<p>
    You see them as they're coming down through corridors of dust specks in the
    light
</p>
<p>
    And as they're moving closer and your blood is flowing faster you realize
</p>
<p>
    That when you come together you will open like a blossom to a butterfly
</p>
<p>
    07:02 On screen, two dragsters move into place at a starting line. The
    narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your horses know the secrets of the grasses
</p>
<p>
    They learn about forever with each tender shoot that passes
</p>
<p>
    The heat beneath their rippling skin is rising in the twilight
</p>
<p>
    And when you come together you will open like blossom to a butterfly
</p>
<p>
    07:32 On screen, the two dragsters are racing down the track. One loses
    control and crashes. The sound of sirens can be heard. The narrator
    continues singing:
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>
    08:04 On screen, images of a distraught drag racer appear. The drag racer
    is speaking to an interviewer. Captions appear showing the drag racer's
    speech: "How bad is he?" A commentator is barely audible, with the phrase
    "the emotions of Don Prudhomme" distinguishable. The narrator continues
    singing:
</p>
<p>
    Rochester oh Rochester
</p>
<p>
    Oh Rochester oh Rochester
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>
    Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>
    08:40 The guitar strumming and the singing of the narrator fade out. On
    screen, the image of the distraught drag racer appears projected on the
    narrator's shirt. A caption appears on the image: "Oh my God." The image
    freezes on the narrator's shirt. The video ends.

    Many of the items in the opening segment are standard citations
    incorporated as images. The video moves slowly through the narration with
    these materials held on screen. The piece also contains a number of video
    clips that provide visual elements. The imagery of wild horses plays a
smaller role in this video than in    <a href="https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4">an earlier iteration</a>, where it
    was primary. Two videos provide the imagery of early drag racing. Those
    videos have been mixed to create a composite with multiple layers.
</p>
<p>
    The text of "A Blessing" is included as part of the academic discussion. In
    this instance, the poem is included in its entirety and transformed as it
    is projected onto surfaces and mixed with the imagery and sonics of the
    piece. The remaining materials are created by the author. There is footage
    with a view of the author's yard from an upstairs window. Mobile phone
    footage also captures the view from the perspective of the guitar. Laptop
    camera footage shows the sung response and the narrator playing guitar.

<h4>Discussion</h4>



<aside class="pullquote-right">Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set
    equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness;
    guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission;
    superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than distraction;
    exposure rather than tact. <span class="attribution"> Rita Felski, <span class="attribution-title">"Suspicious
Minds"</span> (222)</span> </aside>

<p>
    Scholarship often highlights relevant passages from a text, and then
    discusses them. In the opening segments of the video, images show
    quotations about negative aspects of academic critique. "A hermeneutics of
    suspicion dissipates its problem-solving powers and loses much of its
    allure" (Suspicious Minds, 231), Rita Felski tells us. Judith Butler asks
    whether critique can be "something other than the practice of destruction,
    of nay-saying" (795). Timothy Bewes advocates for an approach he calls
    "generous" and notes how such readings can be embodied and resist closure:
    "A generous reading is always, in part, a reading of ourselves reading. The
    thought it produces is never transferable, recognizable, paraphrasable,
    applicable, expoundable" (28). Kathleen Fitzpatrick similarly calls for
    "generous thinking" that asks us to "focus just a bit less on mastery and
    more on connection" (86). These scholars point us away from negativity and
    toward empathy, both in our relations with others and our academic work.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Blessing Critique</em>
    takes up these concerns, and then generates a text with an affective
    message that mixes image, sound, and music. The result is a critical
    response to a poem. Steven Shaviro (following Lev Manovich) suggests that
    digitization flattens information hierarchies so that "perceptual
    impressions . . . cannot be ordered by vision alone" (79). Screen
    compositions feature "other senses, most notably hearing." Sound and music,
    Shaviro explains, have been at "the leading edge of change" (134) as cinema
    has moved into the twenty-first century. At 07:40, a siren can be heard in
    the video while imagery of Don Prudhomme appears on screen. "We now live in
    the midst of an <em>audiovisual continuum</em>" (134), Shaviro writes. This
    continuum emerges as the video response plays with our perceptions of
    empathy by blending the sonic wailing of the ambulance with the anguish in
    the face of the drag racer.
</p>
<p>
    In cinema and digital composing, we expect empathetic, audiovisual mixings.
    In academic responses, we're not sure what to make of them. James Purdy and
    Joyce Walker warn of a tendency to cast what's unfamiliar
    as creative expression, a move that "often privilege[s] print and
    reinscribe[s] the creative-scholarly split" (178). Such reinscription will
    struggle to account for the possibilities of audiovisual response. Instead,
    "when we consider alternative modes, we must also reconsider the methods
    through which they produce knowledge" (182). In a response to James
    Wright's "A Blessing," David Pink tells us, the poem's speaker fulfills a
    desire "to cross the boundaries of being." Purdy and Walker note that "how
we see texts shapes how we see (our) bodies—and vice versa" (184). In    <em>Blessing Critique</em>, a projected image appears on the author's chest
    depicting the distraught face of Don Prudhomme. Boundaries are crossed as
    the response to the poem is projected, sung, and embodied, asking us to
    reconsider what counts as scholarship.

<p>
The response in the version included here is a remake of <a href="https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4">an earlier effort</a> that featured
    horse imagery rather than the motif of drag racing. Gilles Deleuze urges us
    to think of mixing images as "not an operation of association, but of
    differentiation" (174). The switch from horse to drag racing imagery
    represents such a move. Wright's poem deals directly with horses. The video
    that drifts further away gains complexity through distance in its layers of
    meaning. In many ways, this move increases the ambiguity of the video.
    Following Madeline Sorapure, who thinks about how "metaphor exploits
    similarity and substitution, while metonymy exploits contiguity and
    association," we might imagine a continuum from direct to indirect symbolic
    representation that can be deployed through the screen. Composing becomes a
    tuning process for balancing association and distance along the continuum,
    with the results transforming into texts that, in varying degrees, display
    ambiguity or decipherability.
</p>
<p>
    Wright's poem is interpreted here with an open-ended approach. Scholars
    have noted the epiphany that closes the poem, a move built upon the bonds
    of companionship. The poem brings together material boundaries with imagery
    of natural communion: "the horses are enclosed in 'barbed wire'; the poet
    and his friend must transgress an unnatural boundary to enter into the
    natural setting" (Modern American Poetry). All of this crossing evokes a
    sense of transformation that provides the poet with an out-of-body
    experience that is captured in the closing of the poem: "Suddenly I realize
    / That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into blossom."
</p>
<p>
    The video replicates the in/out of body experience in the poem with its own
    closing scene. The projected image offers a layering of media on the body.
    This move is amplified by the intense affect conveyed by the visual
    materials. Shaviro argues that digital videos, "like other media works, are
    machines for generating affect, and for capitalizing upon, or extracting
    value from, this affect" (2–3). Felski points out that affect offers an
    untapped resource that might inspire or evoke impassioned scholarship.
    Projected on the body, video response generates in the body insights or
    feelings, what Gregory Ulmer and Sarah Arroyo (extending Roland Barthes)
    have discussed as the punctum. Arroyo explains,
    "the concept of the punctum . . . provides access to knowledge residing in
    the body" (57). It is the sting, the wound, the spark, the mysterious
    recognition that registers as emotions. Ambiguity flows through these
    emotional moments and materials. Composing in these registers yields a
    scholarship more open to interpretation. In many ways, the most open
    scholarship begins at the 05:00 mark in the video with the embodied
    response to "A Blessing." The reading of the poem that it offers both
    contains and casts forth its secrets.
