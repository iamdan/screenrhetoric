  <p>This video brings together quotations and narration to address the subject
  of alternative scholarship. It also includes a performative response to a
  poem. The performative response contains several layers with images and live
  music.  </p>

  <p>00:00 Title screen: The Blessing of Rescuing Critique, Daniel Anderson,
  @iamdan. The video opens with a quote from Rita Felski displayed on the
  screen: "Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set
  equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness; guardedness
  rather than openness; aggression rather than submission; superiority rather
  than reverence; attentiveness rather than distraction; exposure rather than
  tact. . . . The danger . . . is less its potential brutality than the threat
  of banality." Imagery of wild horses appears in the lower portion of the
  video, accompanied by soft, western-themed music. The narrator speaks: In this
  piece, I show how multimedia invites us to move from concrete to abstract,
  opening avenues for emergent interpretation. I also experiment with a mode of
  response that recognizes some of the limits of critique and closure. Critique
  can be competitive, exclusionary, banal. Closure can lead us to overlook the
  generosity of the world around us, including the world of the texts we study.
  </p>

  <p>[00:37] The text of the poem "A Blessing" begins scrolling on the lower
  half of the screen beneath another Rita Felski excerpt. The narrator speaks:
  "Practicing a mode of alt-scholarship, I created a response to this poem
  scrolling on the screen: 'A Blessing,' by James Wright. The poem is set off a
  rural highway near Rochester, Minnesota. It is about two companions who
  stumble across a pair of horses in a meadow. The poem suggests a bond between
  human and animal and among humans, an emotional connection." </p>

  <p>[01:04] The Rita Felski quote reaches its conclusion on the top half of the
  screen while the Wright poem continues to scroll. The narrator continues: "This
  emotional connection is often lost among the logic of academic closure. But
  affect is linked to abstraction and audio-visual registers, which makes
  multimodal production a space for emergent composing. The works we study are
  rich and ambiguous, unfolding like flowers. Why not our responses?" </p>

  <p>[01:28] The top of the screen now shows a quote from Judith Butler,
  followed by one from Timothy Brewes. In the lower portion of the screen, the poem keeps scrolling. The
  narrator continues: "These kinds of responses can create new subjectivities. 'A
  Blessing' depicts a coming-together, as the speaker and his companion connect
  with 'two Indian ponies.' And the poem extends that human-animal connection
  with a metaphor that transcends the subject/object divide and generates a new
  sense of self, at one with the world. "Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped
  out of my body I would break / Into blossom.” (This spoken quote corresponds
  with the scrolling text.) </p>

  <p>[02:00] On screen a folder displays a number of video files with timestamps
  from December 17, 2015. The narrator speaks: "On a Thursday morning, I worked
  up a response that plays with layering, cameras, and screens." </p>

  <p>[02:08] Imagery of wild horses appears on screen, accompanied by the same
  music from the opening sequence. The narrator continues: "I started with a
  YouTube clip that depicts horses. I began bringing together verbal and visual
  representations; the literal associations translated into mostly corresponding
  moving images. I then used my laptop camera and Photo Booth to film an
  adaptation." </p>

  <p>[02:22] On screen a red guitar held in someone's lap fills the screen. A
  hand begins strumming the guitar. </p>

  <p>[02:33] The volume level of the guitar strumming is lowered. The narrator
  speaks: "Here, we have a typical instance of a camera filming a subject, with
  the added layering of a reflection of the laptop on the surface of the guitar."
  </p>

  <p>[02:46] The guitar strumming fades out. The narrator continues: "At the same
  time I used Snapz to capture the Photo Booth application recording on the
  screen. I used a transparency application to layer the YouTube video over the
  Photo Booth application as it filmed the guitar. SnapZ captured a composite of
  Photo Booth filming and the YouTube video playing." </p>

  <p>03:03 On screen a composite image shows a red guitar and images of wild
  horses on a laptop screen. The words “this machine performs critique with
  compassion” are visible near the top of the composite. A hand begins strumming
  the guitar. </p>

  <p>[03:11] The sound of the guitar fades out. The narrator continues: "I next
  turned on a visualizer and captured a clip with singing." </p>

  <p>03:17 On screen an image of a color bar appears. The narrator sings the
  phrase, "The greener grass starts at the edge of town." The colors in the
  color bar shift and spike in time with the singing. </p>

  <p>[03:25] The color bar on the screen is replaced by the composite image of
  the guitar and horses. The narrator continues: "I also captured a scrolling
  video of the text of the poem. I brought all these materials into a video
  editor, made a few adjustments, and uploaded my response to YouTube. The
  process compressed a couple of hours and several captures into a
  three-and-a-half minute video that interprets the poem through creative
  response." </p>

  <p>03:44 The same composite images, this time framed in a video hosted on YouTube, appear. A
  hand begins strumming the guitar. The narrator sings the phrase, "the greener
  grass starts at the edge of town." </p>

  <p>04:00 The music fades out. The imagery on the screen fades out leaving a
  white screen, which is quickly replaced with a close-up image of a man’s face.
  The man’s expression is distressed. The narrator speaks: "I enjoyed mixing horse
  imagery with music as a response to the poem, but was not satisfied. I wanted
  a response driven more by affect and companionship, something more abstract."
  </p>

  <p>04:13 On screen, a portable projector screen in a dark room appears. On the
  screen a video of drag racers is projected and is sporadically paused and
  fast-forwarded. Segments of the video’s subtitles are occasionally
  visible. The narrator continues: "I started over with this footage of drag racer
  Don Prudhomme, captured just after his competitor's car broke into pieces at
  over 200 miles per hour. Fortunately, the other racer was okay, but Prudhomme
  did not know this at the moment. I combined this clip with segments of another
  video depicting the early days of drag racing, a time that featured what might
  be called a cherished rivalry between Prudhome and fellow racer Tom McEwen.
  The original translation with horses was too literal—horse reference to horse
  image. I wanted to feel and share the generative compassion in the poem.
  Taking another tack, I created this experiment in affective response."

  </p>

  <p>05:00 On screen, the narrator sits down in front of the projector screen.
  The narrator is holding a red guitar and wears a white shirt. The images of
  drag racers are now projected on the shirt of the narrator. The dialogue
  accompanying the drag racing video is audible, but soft. The text of the poem,
  "A Blessing," begins scrolling on screen. A small frame showing the narrator
  singing and playing guitar filmed from a different angle is visible in the
  bottom right corner. The narrator begins playing the guitar. </p>

  <p>05:20 The narrator begins singing:
  </p>

  <p>The greener grass starts at the edge of town

  <p>And there you'll find a wooden house with windows wide
  and porch steps leading down
  </p>
  <p>To a meadow before evening casting dust specks
  in the sunbeams all around
  </p>
  <p>As by the willow tree you walk pulled forward
  by the crickets' talk and the water sound
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your fields are full of horses in the grasses
  </p>
  <p>You step a little closer as each tender moment passes
  </p>
  <p>You know their skin is breathing and the dust smells of forever
  </p>
  <p>You start to think of leaving but you know that you will never
  </p>
  <p>06:26 On screen imagery of two drag racers walking together appears. The narrator continues singing:
  </p>
  <p>And turning from the road two silhouettes in soft shadow
  against the sky
  </p>
  <p>You see them as they're coming down through corridors of dust specks
  in the light
  </p>
  <p>And as they're moving closer and your blood is flowing faster
  you realize
  </p>
  <p>That when you come together you will open like a blossom
  to a butterfly
  </p>
  <p>07:02 On screen two dragsters move into place at a starting line. The narrator continues singing:
  </p>
  Rochester your horses know the secrets of the grasses
  </p>
  <p>They learn about forever with each tender shoot that passes
  </p>
  <p>The heat beneath their rippling skin is rising in the twilight
  </p>
  <p>And when you come together you will open like blossom
  to a butterfly
  </p>
  <p>07:32 On screen the two dragsters are racing down the track. One loses control and crashes. The sound of sirens can be heard. The narrator continues singing:
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe
  </p>

  <p>08:04 On screen, images of a distraught drag racer appears. The drag racer
  is speaking to an interviewer. Captions appear showing the drag racer's
  speech: How bad is he? A commentator is barely audible, with the phrase “the
  emotions of Don Prudhomme” distinguishable. The narrator continues singing:
  </p>

  <p>Rochester oh Rochester
  </p>
  <p>Oh Rochester oh Rochester.
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
  </p>
  <p>Rochester your secret's safe
  </p>

  <p>08:40 The guitar strumming and the singing of the narrator fade out. On
  screen, the image of the distraught drag racer appears projected on the
  narrator's shirt. A caption appears on the image: Oh my God. The image freezes
  on the narrator's shirt. The video ends. </p>

  <p>Many of the items included in the opening segment are standard citations
  incorporated as images into the video. These raise few issues about intellectual
  property but several questions about attention. This video moves slowly through
  the narration with these materials held on the screen so that viewers might take
  them in.
  This reading is complicated by the addition of the poem which scrolls down the
  screen. Ultimately, these attention issues bring us back to the forms in which
  scholarship can be produced. In text, we have no problem, pausing or reading
  backwards to take in materials more slowly. In time-based media, we have the
  same ability, but perhaps not the same expectations.</p>

  <p> The piece also
  contains a number of video clips that are used to provide the visual elements of
  the piece. The imagery of wild horses, plays a smaller role in this video than
  in an earlier an earlier iteration, where it was primary
  (https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4). The imagery of early drag racing is taken from
  multiple videos hosted on YouTube. Those images have been blended and mixed together with
  varying opacities to create a composite with multiple layers.
  </p>

  <p>The text of the short poem, "A Blessing," is included as part of the academic
  discussion of the work. As
  with print essays discussing the poem for scholarly and educatiobnal purposes,
  the video response reproduces the work. In this instance, the poem is also
  transformed as it is projected onto surfaces and mixed with the imagery and
  sonics of the piece. The remaining materials are primarily created by the author. Mobile phone
  footage provides a few of the author's yard scene from an upstairs window. Mobile
  phone footage also captures the view from the perspective of the guitar, revealing a projector.
  Laptop camera footage shows the sung response and the narrator playing guitar.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>



<aside class="pullquote-right">Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche
as . . . a mind-set equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than
closeness; guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission;
superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than distraction;
exposure rather than tact. <span class="attribution"> Rita Felski, "Suspicious
Minds" (222)</span> </aside>

<p>This video was developed as a presentation for the 2016 Computers and Writing
Conference. It opens with number of screens that show citations from articles
that raise questions about traditional methods of scholarly criticism. It also
explores the poem, "A Blessing," by James Wright. The video offers a
 survey of issues associated with scholarship and media composing,
and then an embodied response to "A Blessing."</P>


<p>The background screens in the opening segments of the video consist of
captured images of typed citations taken from scholars writing about the limits
and consequences of overly negative academic critique. "A hermeneutics of
suspicion dissipates its problem-solving powers and loses much of its allure,"
Rita Felski tells us. Judith Butler and Timothy Bewes advocate an alternative
approach that counters suspicion. Bewes calls it "generous," and notes how such
readings can be embodied and resist closure: "A generous reading is always, in
part, a reading of ourselves reading. The thought it produces is never
transferable, recognizable, paraphrasable, applicable, expoundable."</p>



<p>The response, in the version included here, was a remake of <a
href="https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4">an earlier effort</a> that used horse
imagery rather than the motif of drag racing. Gilles Deleuze urges us to think of
mixing images as "not an operation of association, but of differentiation"
(174). The switch from horse to drag racing imagery represents such a move. Wright's poem deals directly with horses. The video that drifts
further away from the direct link gains complexity through extra distance in its
layers of meaning. In many ways this move increases the ambiguity of the video.
Following Madeline Sorapure, who urges media composers to think through how
"metaphor exploits similarity and substitution, while metonymy exploits
contiguity and association," we might imagine a continuum from concrete to
abstract imagery that can be deployed in screen composing. Choosing materials
becomes a tuning process for balancing association and distance along the
continuum, with the results transforming into texts that, in varying degrees, open or close
avenues for response.</p>

</figure>


<p>  James Wright's poem is read here with these open-ended approaches.
Scholars have noted the epiphany that closes the poem, a move built upon
the bonds of companionship. The poem brings together material boundaries with
imagery of natural communion: "the horses are enclosed in 'barbed wire'; the
poet and his friend must transgress an unnatural boundary to enter into the
natural setting" (Modern American Poetry). All of this crossing evokes a sense of moving beyond
boundaries that provides the poet with an out-of-body experience. The experience
of mixing and of moving beyond the body is captured in the closing of the poem:
"Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into
blossom."</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Neither the knower nor the known can be situated in advance of the occasion’s coming to be—both are
immanent to the field’s composition. Nor can the knower-known relation be classified independently
of the ecologies that compose it, including those whose register is unquantifiable, such as the
quality or affective tonality of experience. <span class="attribution"> Erin Manning and Brian Massumi <strong>Thought in Act</strong> (30)</span></aside>

<p>The video replicates the in/out of body experience of the poem in its own closing scene. The choice to
make the primary surface of the piece the shirt of the narrator offers a direct
layering of media on the body. This move is amplified by the high levels of
affect conveyed by the visual materials. Steven Shaviro argues that digital
videos "like other media works, are <em>machines for generating affect</em>, and
for capitalizing upon, or extracting value from, this affect" (2-3). Felski
points out that affect offers an untapped resource for scholarship that might
inspire or evoke empassioned responses. Projected <em>on</em> the body, emotions
light <em>in</em> the body as insights or feelings, what Roland Barthes,
Gregory Ulmer, and Sarah Arroyo have discussed as the punctum.  Arroyo explains, "the
concept of the punctum . . .  provides access to knowledge residing in the body"
(57). It is the sting, the wound, the spark, the mysterious recognition that
registers as emotions.</p>


<p>Ambiguity flows through these emotional moments and materials. Composing in
these registers yields a scholarship more open to interpretation. In many ways
the most open scholarship begins at the 05:00 mark in the video, with the images
projected on the body and the sung response to "A Blessing."
The reading of the poem that it
offers both contains and casts forth its secrets.
