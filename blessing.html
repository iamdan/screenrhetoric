<p>This video brings together a number of quotations and narration to discuss the subject of alternative scholarship. It also shows a performative response to a poem. The performative response contains several layers with images and live music. The transcript below captures the narration and performed response and key texts on screen.
</p>
<p>00:00 Title screen: The Blessing of Rescuing Critique Daniel Anderson @iamdan. The video opens with the text of a quote on the screen (See aside). Imagery of wild horses appears in the lower portion of the video. The narrator speaks: In this piece, I show how multimedia invites us to move from concrete to abstract, opening avenues for emergent interpretation. I also experiment with a mode of response that recognizes some of the limits of critique and closure. Critique can be competitive, exclusionary, banal. Closure can lead us to overlook the generosity of the world around us, including the world of the texts we study.
</p>
<p>[00:37] The text of  the poem, "A Blessing" begins scrolling on the screen. The narrator speaks: Practicing a mode of alt-scholarship, I created a response to this poem scrolling on the screen, "A Blessing," by James Wright. The poem is set off a rural highway near Rochester, Minnesota. It is about two companions who stumble across a pair of horses in a meadow. The poem suggests a bond between human and animal and among humans, an emotional connection.
</p>
<p>[01:04] The narrator continues speaking: This emotional connection is often lost among the logic of academic closure. But multimodal is well suite to convey affect. Can it also help us produce critical analyis that resists closure? The works we study are rich and ambiguous, connecting with all of our senses, unfolding like flowers. Why not our responses?
</p>
<p>[01:28] The narrator continues: These kinds of responses can create new subjectivities. "A Blessing" depicts a coming together as the speaker and his companion connect with "two Indian ponies." And the poem extends that human-animal connection with a metaphor that transcends the subject/object divide and generates a new sense of self at one with the world. "Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into blossom."
</p>
<p>[02:00] On screen a folder displays a number of videos with timestamps from December 17, 2015. The narrator speaks: On a Thursday morning, I worked up a response that plays with layering, cameras, and screens.
</p>
<p>[02:08] Imagery of wild horses appears on screen. The narrator continues: I started with a YouTube clip that depicts horses. I began bringing together verbal and visual representations; the literal associations translated into mostly corresponding moving images. I then used my laptop camera and Photobooth to film an adaptation.
</p>
<p>[02:22] On screen a red guitar held in someone's lap fills the screen. A hand begins strumming the guitar.
</p>
<p>[02:33] The volume level of the guitar strumming is lowered. The narrator speaks: Here, we have a typical instance of a camera filming a subject, with the added layering of a reflection of the laptop on the surface of the guitar.
</p>
<p>[02:46] The guitar strumming fades out. The narrator continues: At the same time I used Snapz to capture the Photobooth application recording on the screen. I used a transparency application to layer the YouTube video over the Photobooth application as it filmed the guitar. SnapZ captured a composite of Photobooth filming and the YouTube video playing.
</p>
<p>03:03 On screen a composite image shows a red guitar and images of wild horses on a laptop screen. A hand begins strumming the guitar.
</p>
<p>[03:11] The sound of the guitar fades out. The narrator continues: I next turned on a visualizer and captured a clip with singing.
</p>
<p>03:17 On screen an image of a color bar appears. The narrator sings the phrase, "The greener grass starts at the edge or town." The colors in the color bar shift and spike in time with the singing.
</p>
<p>[03:25] The narrator continues: I also captured a scrolling video of the text of the poem. I brought all these materials into a video editor, made a few adjustments, and uploaded my response to YouTube. The process compressed a couple of hours and several captures into a three-and-a-half minute video that interprets the poem through creative response.
</p>
<p>03:44 On screen a composite image shows a red guitar and imagery of wild horses. A hand begins strumming the guitar. The narrator sings the phrase, "the greener grass starts at the edge of town."
</p>
<p>04:00 The music fades out. The imagery on the screen fades out leaving a white screen. The narrator speaks: I enjoyed mixing horse imagery with music as a response to the poem, but was not satisfied. I wanted a response driven more by affect and companionship, something more abstract.
</p>
<p>04:13 On screen a portable projector screen in a dark room appears. On the screen images of drag racers is projected. The narrator continues: I started over with this footage of drag racer Don Prudhome captured just after his competitor's car broke into pieces at over 200 miles per hour. Fortunately, the other racer was okay, but Prudhome did not know this at the moment. I combined this clip with segments of another video depicting the early days of drag racing, a time that featured what might be called a cherished rivalry between Prudhome and fellow racer Tom McEwen. The original translation with horses was too literal—horse reference to horse image. I wanted to feel and share the generative compassion in the poem. Taking another tack, I created this experiment in affective response.
</p>
<p>05:00 On screen, the narrator sits down in front of the projector screen. The narrator is holding a red guitar and wears a white shirt. The images of drag racers are now projected on the shirt of the figure. The text of the poem, "A Blessing" begings scrolling on screen. The narrator begins playing the guitar.
</p>
<p>05:20 The narrator begins singing:
</p>
<p>The greener grass starts at the edge of town

<p>And there you'll find a wooden house with windows wide
and porch steps leading down
</p>
<p>To a meadow before evening casting dust specks
in the sunbeams all around
</p>
<p>As by the willow tree you walk pulled forward
by the crickets' talk and the water sound
</p>
<p>05:53 On screen, layered imagery of the red guitar and drag racing appears. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester your fields are full of horses in the grasses
</p>
<p>You step a little closer as each tender moment passes
</p>
<p>You know their skin is breathing and the dust smells of forever
</p>
<p>You start to think of leaving but you know that you will never
</p>
<p>06:26 On screen imagery of two drag racers walking together appears. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>And turning from the road two silhouettes in soft shadow
against the sky
</p>
<p>You see them as they're coming down through corridors of dust specks
in the light
</p>
<p>And as they're moving closer and your blood is flowing faster
you realize
</p>
<p>That when you come together you will open like a blossom
to a butterfly
</p>
<p>07:02 On screen two dragsters move into place at a starting line. The narrator continues singing:
Rochester your horses know the secrets of the grasses
</p>
<p>They learn about forever with each tender shoot that passes
</p>
<p>The heat beneath their rippling skin is rising in the twilight
</p>
<p>And when you come together you will open like blossom
to a butterfly
</p>
<p>07:32 On screen the two dragsters are racing down the track. One loses control and crashes. The sound of sirens can be heard. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>08:04 On screen images of a distraught drag racer appears. The drag racer is speaking to an interviewer. Captions appear showing the drag racer's speech: How bad is he? The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester oh Rochester
</p>
<p>Oh Rochester oh Rochester.
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>08:40 The guitar strumming and the narrator singing fade out. On screen the image of the distraught drag racer appears projected on the narrator's shirt. A caption appears on the image: Oh my God. The image freezes on the narrator's shirt. The video ends.

<h2>About the Video</h2>

This video
opens with segments that present explication and citation related to the subject
of alternative scholarship. It then transitions into a critical response to the
poem, "A Blessing," by James Wright. The narration and response to the poem were
first performed at the  2016 Computers and Writing Conference. The response,
however, was a remake of an earlier effort that used horse imagery rather than
the motif of drag racing in this version. The switch from horse to racing
imagery represents a move from the concrete to the abstract. Wright's poem deals
directly with horses. The video that drifts further away from the direct link
gains complexity through extra layers of meaning. 

  <aside class="pullquote-left"> Metaphor exploits similarity and substitution, while
metonymy exploits contiguity and association. -- Madeline Sorapure </aside>



<aside class="pullquote-right">Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set
equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness;
guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission;
superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than
distraction; exposure rather than tact.
