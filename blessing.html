<p>This video brings together a number of quotations and narration to discuss the subject of alternative scholarship. It also shows a performative response to a poem. The performative response contains several layers with images and live music. The transcript below captures the narration and performed response and key texts on screen.
</p>
<p>00:00 Title screen: The Blessing of Rescuing Critique Daniel Anderson @iamdan. The video opens with the text of a quote on the screen (See aside). Imagery of wild horses appears in the lower portion of the video. The narrator speaks: In this piece, I show how multimedia invites us to move from concrete to abstract, opening avenues for emergent interpretation. I also experiment with a mode of response that recognizes some of the limits of critique and closure. Critique can be competitive, exclusionary, banal. Closure can lead us to overlook the generosity of the world around us, including the world of the texts we study.
</p>
<p>[00:37] The text of  the poem, "A Blessing" begins scrolling on the screen. The narrator speaks: Practicing a mode of alt-scholarship, I created a response to this poem scrolling on the screen, "A Blessing," by James Wright. The poem is set off a rural highway near Rochester, Minnesota. It is about two companions who stumble across a pair of horses in a meadow. The poem suggests a bond between human and animal and among humans, an emotional connection.
</p>
<p>[01:04] The narrator continues speaking: This emotional connection is often lost among the logic of academic closure. But multimodal is well suite to convey affect. Can it also help us produce critical analyis that resists closure? The works we study are rich and ambiguous, connecting with all of our senses, unfolding like flowers. Why not our responses?
</p>
<p>[01:28] The narrator continues: These kinds of responses can create new subjectivities. "A Blessing" depicts a coming together as the speaker and his companion connect with "two Indian ponies." And the poem extends that human-animal connection with a metaphor that transcends the subject/object divide and generates a new sense of self at one with the world. "Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into blossom."
</p>
<p>[02:00] On screen a folder displays a number of videos with timestamps from December 17, 2015. The narrator speaks: On a Thursday morning, I worked up a response that plays with layering, cameras, and screens.
</p>
<p>[02:08] Imagery of wild horses appears on screen. The narrator continues: I started with a YouTube clip that depicts horses. I began bringing together verbal and visual representations; the literal associations translated into mostly corresponding moving images. I then used my laptop camera and Photobooth to film an adaptation.
</p>
<p>[02:22] On screen a red guitar held in someone's lap fills the screen. A hand begins strumming the guitar.
</p>
<p>[02:33] The volume level of the guitar strumming is lowered. The narrator speaks: Here, we have a typical instance of a camera filming a subject, with the added layering of a reflection of the laptop on the surface of the guitar.
</p>
<p>[02:46] The guitar strumming fades out. The narrator continues: At the same time I used Snapz to capture the Photobooth application recording on the screen. I used a transparency application to layer the YouTube video over the Photobooth application as it filmed the guitar. SnapZ captured a composite of Photobooth filming and the YouTube video playing.
</p>
<p>03:03 On screen a composite image shows a red guitar and images of wild horses on a laptop screen. A hand begins strumming the guitar.
</p>
<p>[03:11] The sound of the guitar fades out. The narrator continues: I next turned on a visualizer and captured a clip with singing.
</p>
<p>03:17 On screen an image of a color bar appears. The narrator sings the phrase, "The greener grass starts at the edge or town." The colors in the color bar shift and spike in time with the singing.
</p>
<p>[03:25] The narrator continues: I also captured a scrolling video of the text of the poem. I brought all these materials into a video editor, made a few adjustments, and uploaded my response to YouTube. The process compressed a couple of hours and several captures into a three-and-a-half minute video that interprets the poem through creative response.
</p>
<p>03:44 On screen a composite image shows a red guitar and imagery of wild horses. A hand begins strumming the guitar. The narrator sings the phrase, "the greener grass starts at the edge of town."
</p>
<p>04:00 The music fades out. The imagery on the screen fades out leaving a white screen. The narrator speaks: I enjoyed mixing horse imagery with music as a response to the poem, but was not satisfied. I wanted a response driven more by affect and companionship, something more abstract.
</p>
<p>04:13 On screen a portable projector screen in a dark room appears. On the screen images of drag racers is projected. The narrator continues: I started over with this footage of drag racer Don Prudhome captured just after his competitor's car broke into pieces at over 200 miles per hour. Fortunately, the other racer was okay, but Prudhome did not know this at the moment. I combined this clip with segments of another video depicting the early days of drag racing, a time that featured what might be called a cherished rivalry between Prudhome and fellow racer Tom McEwen. The original translation with horses was too literal—horse reference to horse image. I wanted to feel and share the generative compassion in the poem. Taking another tack, I created this experiment in affective response.
</p>
<p>05:00 On screen, the narrator sits down in front of the projector screen. The narrator is holding a red guitar and wears a white shirt. The images of drag racers are now projected on the shirt of the figure. The text of the poem, "A Blessing" begings scrolling on screen. The narrator begins playing the guitar.
</p>
<p>05:20 The narrator begins singing:
</p>
<p>The greener grass starts at the edge of town

<p>And there you'll find a wooden house with windows wide
and porch steps leading down
</p>
<p>To a meadow before evening casting dust specks
in the sunbeams all around
</p>
<p>As by the willow tree you walk pulled forward
by the crickets' talk and the water sound
</p>
<p>05:53 On screen, layered imagery of the red guitar and drag racing appears. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester your fields are full of horses in the grasses
</p>
<p>You step a little closer as each tender moment passes
</p>
<p>You know their skin is breathing and the dust smells of forever
</p>
<p>You start to think of leaving but you know that you will never
</p>
<p>06:26 On screen imagery of two drag racers walking together appears. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>And turning from the road two silhouettes in soft shadow
against the sky
</p>
<p>You see them as they're coming down through corridors of dust specks
in the light
</p>
<p>And as they're moving closer and your blood is flowing faster
you realize
</p>
<p>That when you come together you will open like a blossom
to a butterfly
</p>
<p>07:02 On screen two dragsters move into place at a starting line. The narrator continues singing:
Rochester your horses know the secrets of the grasses
</p>
<p>They learn about forever with each tender shoot that passes
</p>
<p>The heat beneath their rippling skin is rising in the twilight
</p>
<p>And when you come together you will open like blossom
to a butterfly
</p>
<p>07:32 On screen the two dragsters are racing down the track. One loses control and crashes. The sound of sirens can be heard. The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>08:04 On screen images of a distraught drag racer appears. The drag racer is speaking to an interviewer. Captions appear showing the drag racer's speech: How bad is he? The narrator continues singing:
</p>
<p>Rochester oh Rochester
</p>
<p>Oh Rochester oh Rochester.
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe with me
</p>
<p>Rochester your secret's safe
</p>
<p>08:40 The guitar strumming and the narrator singing fade out. On screen the image of the distraught drag racer appears projected on the narrator's shirt. A caption appears on the image: Oh my God. The image freezes on the narrator's shirt. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>Many of the items included in the opening segment are standard citations
incorporated as images into the video. These raise few issues about intellectual
property but several questions about attention. This video moves slowly through
the narration with these materials held on the screen so that viewers might take
them in. Listening to narration and processing the textual images on screen,
however, requires the "reader" to process two informational channels at once.
This challenge is complicated by the addition of the poem which scrolls down the
screen. Ultimately, these attention issues bring us back to the forms in which
scholarship can be produced. In text, we have no problem, pausing or reading
backwards to take in materials more slowly. In time-based media, we have the
same ability, but perhaps not the same expectations.</p>

<p> The piece also
contains a number of video clips that are used to provide the visual elements of
the piece. The imagery of wild horses, plays a smaller role in this video than
in an earlier an earlier iteration, where it was primary
(https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4). The imagery of early drag racing is taken from
multiple YouTube videos. Those images have been blended and mixed together with
varying opacities to create a composite with multiple layers. These materials
are transformed when translated to multiple surfaces, including a reflection on
the guitar surface and projection on the narrator's body.
</p>

<p>The text of the poem, "A Blessing" is included as part of the academic
discussion of the work. The poem is short and with very few exceptions,
scholarship that takes up the work reproduces the text in its discussion. As
with print essays discussing the poem for scholarly and educatiobnal purposes,
the video response reproduces the work. In this instance, the poem is also
transformed as it is projecton onto surfaces and mixed with the imagery and
sonics of the piece.</p>

<p>The remaining materials also primarily created by the author Cell phone
footage provides a few of the author's yard scene from an upstairs window. Cell
phone footage also captures the view out from the guitar, revealing a projector.
Webcam footage shows the sung response and the narrator playing guitar, which
have been created by the author.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>



<aside class="pullquote-right">Suspicious reading inscribes itself in the psyche as . . . a mind-set
equipped with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness;
guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission;
superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than
distraction; exposure rather than tact. -- Rita Felski, Suspicious Minds
</aside>

<p>This video opens with number of screens that show citations from articles
that look at problems with methods of scholarly criticism. It then transitions into a
critical response to the poem, "A Blessing," by James Wright. The narration and
response to the poem were first performed at the  2016 Computers and Writing
Conference.</P>




<p>The background screens in the opening segments of the video consists of
captured images of typed citations taken from scholars writing about the limits
and consequences of overly negative academic critique. "A hermeneutics of
suspicion dissipates its problem-solving powers and loses much of its allure,"
Rita Felski tells us. Judth Butler and Timothy Bewes advocate an alternative
approach that counters suspicion. Bewes calls it "generous," and notes how such
readings can be emdodied and resist closure: "A generous reading is always, in
part, a reading of ourselves reading. The thought it produces is never
transferable, recognizable, paraphrasable, applicable, expoundable"</p>

  alt="screenshot of Abandonded draft of video"> <figcaption> <p>The earlier
  draft used horse imagery in a direct reference to the poem.</p> </figcaption>
  </figure>


<p>The response, in the version included here was a remake of <a
href="https://youtu.be/2dp29ZkZ-J4">an earlier effort</a> that used horse imagery
rather than the motif of drag racing. The switch from horse to racing imagery
represents a move from the concrete to the abstract. Wright's poem deals
directly with horses. The video that drifts further away from the direct link
gains complexity through extra distance in its layers of meaning. In many ways
this move increases the ambiguity of the video. Following Madeline Sorapure, who
compares metaphor to metonomy, suggesting, "metaphor exploits similarity and
substitution, while metonymy exploits contiguity and association," we might
imagine a continuum from concrete to abstract imagery that can be deployed in
screen composing. Choosing materials becomes a tuning process for balancing
allusions and distance along the continuum, with the results transforming into
texts that might open or close avenues for response.</p>



<p>  James Wright's poem is a fine candidate for these open-ended approaches.
Scholars have noted the epiphany that closes the poem, a move built upon
conjecture over companionship. The poem brings together material boundaries with
imagery of natural communion: "the horses are enclosed in 'barbed wire'; the
poet and his friend must transgress an unnatural boundary to enter into the
natural setting" (Pink 44). All of this crossing evokes a sense of moving beyond
boundaries that provides the poet with an out-of-body experience. The experience
of mixing and of moving beyond the body is embodied in the closing of the poem:
"Suddenly I realize / That if I stepped out of my body I would break / Into
blossom."</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Neither the knower nor the known can be situated in advance of the occasion’s coming to be—both are
immanent to the field’s composition. Nor can the knower- known relation be classified independently
of the ecologies that compose it, including those whose register is unquantifiable, such as the
quality or affective tonality of experience. -- Thought in Action 30</aside>

<p>The video replicates this embodiment in its own closing scene. The choice to
make the primary surface of the piece the shirt of the narrator offers a literal
placement of media on the body. This move is amplified by the high levels of
affect conveyed by the visual materials. Steven Shaviro argues that digital
videos "like other media works, are <em>machines for generating affect</em>, and
for capitalizing upon, or extracting value from, this affect" (2-3). Felski
points out that affect offers an untapped resource for scholarship that might
inspire or evoke empassioned responses. Projected <em>on</em> the body, emotions
light <em>in</em> the body as insights or feelings, what Roland Barthes and
Gregory Ulmer have discussed as the puunctum. Sarah Arroyo explains, "The
concept of the punctum . . .  provides access to knowledge residing in the body"
(57). It is the sting, the wound, the spark, the mysterious recognition that
registers as emotions.</p>

<p>Ambiguity flows through these emotional moments and materials. Composing in
these registers yields a scholarship more open to interpretation. Pushing the
focus of the compostion to creative production adds more ambiguity. In many ways
the most open scholarship begins at the 05:00 mark in the video, with the images
projected on the body and the sung response. The reading of the poem that it
offers both contains and casts forth its secrets.
