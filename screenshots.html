<p>This video is recording of a performance that brings together several video clips hosted by YouTube, a web browser window with a discussion forum posting, an audio recording of the reading of that discussion forum posting, and two windows containing a video with a layered montage of painted surfing imagery and other screen elements. This version was recorded on February 8th, 2012 and posted to vimeo.com.
</p>
<p>The video opens with a video containing painted surfing imagery filling the screen. A web browser with a discussion forum posting and an audio player are brought on screen. The cursor turns into a spotlight and slowly moves over the text in the posting. The audio play button is selected and a voice begins to read along: Mealea warned me. Over dinner, after a fabulous talk about the ways in which artifacts are not texts, or at least are not necessarily texts.
 </p>
<p>00:25 A web browser window appears on screen that contains a video hosted by YouTube. At the top of the window appears the title: Butthole Surfers – Pepper. The cursor selects play on the video and the song and music video begin to play. The audio recording continues to play: And the ways in which those of us want everything to be a text can mess things up trying to make the world match what we want or even what we need it to be while not recognizing the world for what it is. We want to control the world, rather than be of the world.
 </p>
<p>00:40 A web browser window with a video hosted by YouTube appears on screen. At the top appear the title: Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan. The cursor selects play and a figure appears in the video and begins speaking: All of the film I shot in the beginning of my career, I shot in widescreen. The cursor adjusts the materials on screen to partially block the discussion forum posting. The audio continues: And so Disney has its own cacophony, a unique soundscape that only is Disney. And I’m not only or necessarily talking about what may have popped into your brains: It’s a Small World, or perhaps (if you are old enough) the Sunday night Disney show theme with Tinkerbell arriving to make the castle tip glow like a fallen star. No, I am talking about the incessant, relentless sales pitch of what <i>else</i> you can do at the world’s happiest fucking place even though you just plunked down 200 bucks for a day of theme park tickets. And I think: damn! That’s almost 27 hours at minimum wage!
</p>
<p>01:30 The cursor turns down the volume on the clip with the figure speaking in the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video. The audio continues to play: Marky got with Sharon And Sharon got Sharice She was sharing Sharon's outlook On the topic of disease Mikey had a facial scar And Bobby was a racist They were all in love with dyin' They were doing it in Texas
</p>
<p>01:50. The cursor turns up the volume on the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video. The audio continues: So I’m in this fucking bus with two dozen English teachers. Not English Professors, who are bad enough, but grizzled boogery middle school and high school teachers with bad comb-overs and thematic holiday sweaters
</p>
<p>02:00 The cursor brings forward a web browser window that contains a video hosted by YouTube. At the top appears the title: Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1. The cursor presses play on the video. The audio continues: Who give you extra credit for bringing them cat food coupons, and double the credit if they’re worth a free can of icky cat food and you hope to whatever you deem holy that they do indeed have fifteen cats
</p>
<p>02:15 The cursor rearranges the window on screen to frame the text of the discussion forum posting. The cursor turns into a spotlight that follows the text as the audio continues: And the stories of Mister Whiskers padding across the new translation of Dostoyevsky they are reading religiously evenings over earl grey that there is a Mister Whiskers and this isn’t a sad, quiet way of making ends meet because I live in a country that thinks teachers aren’t professionals and its okay for the Jocks to get the girls and then take home all the money too because business administration is much more important than teaching zit-faced kids the importance of Being … no, too easy a joke. But you get where that was going, right Health Class survivors?
</p>
<p>02:52 The cursor brings forward the audio player and presses pause. The reading of the discussion forum posting stops. The audio from the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video can be heard: Now look what happens if we pan and scan this. There’s nothing wrong with that as an image. But it’s not the image that I as a filmmaker wanted you to see.
</p>
<p>03:04 The cursor brings a video player to the front of the screen, blocking out all other windows. The screen fills with painted surfing imagery mixed with other screen materials. The audio from the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video continues: If I wanted to work in this four-by-three format, I would choose to work in that and have, often, as many directors have. And directors do wonderful movies in that format, but they know they are working in that format, so they give you the information that they think you need in that format.
</p>
<p>03:27 The cursor brings the audio player forward and selects play. The cursor brings the web browser windows forward, replacing the surfing imagery. As the video playing the song Pepper moves into the chorus of the song, the recording of the discussion forum posting continues: I don't mind the sun sometimes The images it shows I can taste you on my lips And smell you in my clothes Cinnamon and sugary And softly spoken lies You never know just how you look Through other people's eyes
</p>
<p>03:49 In the video Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1, two white male figures on horseback cup their hands to their mouths. Owl sounds are heard in the video. The audio reading of the discussion forum posting continues: And the fucking relentless soundtrack is blaring in my ears, telling me how I have to get to this and that attraction, and that even when I’m exhausted I can spend more to get rejuvenated to go out and spend yet more because the hype is all about maximizing the flow of cash while you’re in the park.
</p>
<p>04:09 in the Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1 video, figures in US cavalry uniforms are seen in battle with shirtless American Indian figures. The video is mostly blocked from site by the video with painted surfing imagery. Gunshots are heard. The audio recording continues to play: And I’m sitting there thinking about and counting all the hours that it takes to make a two-day park-hopper pass at $7.75 and hour, listening to not just how much I’ve just flushed into the rich man’s pockets, but how much more still there is in my pockets that he (some faceless he – worse to me than Winston’s big man will ever be to me.
</p>
<p>04:30 The cursor brings the Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1 video forward and turns up the volume slider. Battle sounds can be heard. The audio recording continues:  Because this dillwad’s actually got his hands in my fucking pockets taking the cash out, one digit at a time) he, He has every right to do it, and in my own small way, I’m obligated to bend over and take the rogering because, well, it was my own damn free will that had me down here in Baudrilliard’s back yard, watching vultures (how appropriate) taking a rest on their commute to the Yucatan.
</p>
<p>05:00 The cursor brings forward the Pepper music video and scrubs the playhead to the 02:15 mark. In the video appear two figures acting out an old-west shooting scene. The audio recording of the discussion forum posting continues: Some will die in hot pursuit And fiery auto crashes Some will die in hot pursuit While sifting through my ashes Some will fall in love with life And drink it from a fountain That is pouring like an avalanche Coming down the mountain
</p>
<p>05:15 The audio recording of the discussion forum posting stops. The figure speaking in the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video can be heard: If a director chooses to tell a story for whatever reason in this ration, because they want all this information, it’s not fair for somebody else to tell you with our name on it, that this is what we shot.
</p>
<p>05:30 Battle sounds and screaming can be heard in the Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1 video. The figure in the Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video continues: I didn’t shoot that. The cursor brings forward the Davy Crockett, Kind of the Wild Frontier – Part 1. In the video cavalry figures and the figure from the horse point rifles at American Indians holding bows. Gunshot are heard. And American Indian figure falls from a cliff ledge as the cursor selects pause on the video. The cursor fades out the sound on the Pepper video. The cursor minimizes all the materials on screen. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>Jason Loan's "Tooling with Ambient Response" http://vimeo.com/35816842 extends the boundaries of this
video with its connection to earlier projects. Uploaded to vimeo three days (Jan
28th, 2012) before the initial experiments with Screenshots, the piece itself is
a crystalization of several months of video exchange between Loan and the
author. Two days prior (January 26th) the author had uploaded a video titled
"Spontaneous Overflow (Spillover)" https://vimeo.com/35730075 to vimeo. That
Spillover video is a capturing of materials leftover from the process of
creating the video, Waves. It also includes a video compilation of quotations
from creativity researcher, Keith Sawyer.  "Tooling with Ambient Response" is
Loan's reworking of the spillover video. Loan has added elements to the piece,
including a web broadcast by poet Steve Roggenbuck, painted surfing imagery
</p>

The discussion forum posting by Michael Salvo is also a core element of the
video. Acting as a respondent to HASTAC's publication of a collection of
materails on sound, Salvo experiments with the form of the academic response,
weaving sound into the prose via song lyrics and striking a tone that might be
cast as cynical, irritated, resistant. This posting has been read aloud by the
video author, and then incorporated into the performance as an audio file.

The rest of the materials in the piece are videos played directly from the
hosting site, YouTube. "Butthole Surfers - Pepper," "Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan," and "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier -
Part 1" were all played directly from the web during the live performance of the piece.

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> In such conditions, my eyes no longer 'know'
where to look. The media experiencer can no longer be figured as "spectator,"
standing apart from and overlooking a homogenous visual field. Rather, he or she
must parse multiple, windowed image sources as rhythmic patterns and as
information fields.  Post Cinematic Affect 79</aside>

<p>This video was made by recording the screen and bringing media materials
together through a live performance. The materials include multiple browser and
media windows, so that the final compilation includes lots of edges and
adjustments as windows are arranged. The occasion for the piece was created in
part by encountering the video clip, Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan, in which Sydney
Pollack warns against reformating films to four-by-three formats. Concurrently,
a piece called Feel the Noise: Sound, Music, & Technology was published on the
HASTAC web site. Michael Salvo, as a respondent to the piece, composed the text
that is used in the video. On the evening of January 31st, 2012 and the
afternoon and evening of Febuary 8th, 2012, multiple improvisation and testing
mixes were performed. The performance of February 8th recorded at 9:09PM is the
final capture.</p>

<p>In Ambient Rhetoric, Thomas Rickert points out that "the boundaries between
brain and body, self and world, language and thought, beginning and end, are
permable" (100). Like Gregory Ulmer today and Plato long ago, Rickert offers
space and a sense of place through the concept of chora as a frame for ambient
composing. Place in this light is not a call for "presence" but a contextual
means of engaging the material world. "It includes the background by means of
which things show up as what they are" (55) The boundaries are permeable, so the
"background recedes, or withdraws, even as it generates." This sense of place is
evokes displacement as composers mix with materials among these emerging spaces.
For Rickert, it calls for rhetorics not fully commensurate with familiar modes
of representation. Following Derrida, Rickert notes that the concept "disrupts
representation itself (and hence rhetoric, too, if it is conceived in terms of
sybolicity) even while it remains fundamental for the passage of representation"
(55). </p>

<p>Boundaries can't be easily fixed as spatial or choric knowledge has a
"performative dimension . . . that replaces (or, better, reworks) the fixed
places of topic invention" (71)  In Screenshots, the video Widescreen vs. Pan &
Scan features Sydney Pollock noting the differing compositional strategies a
director might deploy depending on screen format. A wide format, for instance,
shifts aspects of film time, as the director "can tell much more story, faster
with all of that space to use." Pollock seeks to regain control of film
information by giving directors authority to make decisions about format.
Ambient approaches, however, suggest that regardless of the size of the canvas,
the composer articulates a message by engaging (through performance) a world in
which boundries constantly shift so that "disclosure is itself manifold and
ambient; it can be performed, practiced, and activated in many ways, only so
much of which will be directly appropriable to consciousness, intention, or
theorization" (72).

 </p>
 <aside class="pullquote-right">After World War II, the television frame
 stabilized at a size of four unit wide by three units high--the same dimensions
 as those of movie screens at the time . . . Originally, the elongation of the
 film frame was realized as a response to the percieved threat of television in
 the postwar decade. Film producers reasoned that theatrical films must give
 viewers something they cannot get from television -- Video Art Theory 38
 </aside>

<p>Erin Manning and Brian Massumi take up the relationship between framing and
invention as they articulate an approach to scholarship developed around
research-creation. Noting that "emergent process, dedicated to the singular
occurrence of the new, agitates inventively in an open field. Programmed
organization, on the other hand, functions predictably in a bounded frame and
lends itself to reproduction." Moving toward research-creation requires paradigms
"of conditioning, rather than framing. The difference is that conditioning
consists in bringing co-causes into interaction" (93).  Manning expands on this
bringing together as she discusses the concept of the machinic, noting that "to
render something 'machinic' is to inscribe it in a process that couples it with
the environment out of which it emerges" (Relationscapes 87).</p>


<p>Switching to "conditioning, rather than framing" offers a renewed mode of
understanding something like screen format for composers. Manning and Massumi
point out that, even during interactions between research-creators and their
environments, "enabling constraints" are needed. "An enabling constraint is
positive in its dynamic effect, even though it may be limiting in its form/force
narrowly considered" (93). The frame becomes less a means of keeping information
in or out and more a material resistance that enables creators to productively
work with materials. In this way, working with aspect ratios might be seen as
technique that shape (and are shaped by) the movements between screen composers
and their environments. "Techniques are not descriptive devices—-they are springboards. They are not framing devices—-they
activate a practice from within. They set in motion" (x).
