  <p>This video is recording of a performance that brings together several video
  clips hosted by YouTube, a discussion forum posting, an audio recording of the
  reading of that discussion forum posting, and windows containing a video
  with a layered montage of painted surfing imagery.
  This version was recorded on February 8th, 2012 and posted to Vimeo. </p>

  <p> 00:00 A video containing painted surfing imagery fills the screen. A web
  browser with a discussion forum posting is brought on
  screen. The cursor turns into a spotlight and slowly moves over the text in
  the posting. An audio player is brought on screen. The play button is selected, and a voice begins to read
  the text of the disussion forum posting: “Mealea warned me. Over dinner, after a fabulous talk about the ways
  in which artifacts are not texts, or at least are not necessarily texts.”
  </p>

<p>00:25 A web browser window appears on screen that contains a video hosted by YouTube,
titled “Butthole Surfers – Pepper.” The cursor selects play on the video and the
music video begins to play. The audio recording continues to play: “And the
ways in which those of us want everything to be a text can mess things up trying
to make the world match what we want or even what we need it to be while not
recognizing the world for what it is. We want to control the world, rather than
be of the world.” </p>

<p>00:40 Another video hosted by YouTube appears on screen, next to the music
video and above the surfing images, this one titled: “Widescreen vs. Pan &
Scan.” The cursor selects play and a figure [Sydney Pollack] appears in the video and begins
speaking, his voice overlapping with the reading of the discussion forum posting and the music: “All of the
film I shot in the beginning of my career, I shot in widescreen.” The cursor
adjusts the materials on screen to partially block the discussion forum posting.
The reading of the discussion forum posting continues: “And so Disney has its own cacophony, a unique
soundscape that only is Disney. And I’m not only or necessarily talking about
what may have popped into your brains: It’s a Small World, or perhaps (if you
are old enough) the Sunday night Disney show theme with Tinkerbell arriving to
make the castle tip glow like a fallen star. No, I am talking about the
incessant, relentless sales pitch of what <i>else</i> you can do at the world’s
happiest fucking place even though you just plunked down 200 bucks for a day of
theme park tickets. And I think: damn! That’s almost 27 hours at minimum wage!”
</p>

<p>01:30 The cursor turns down the volume on the clip with the figure speaking
in the “Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan video.” In the bottom right corner, footage
from Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier is silently playing in a video
hosted by YouTube. The audio recorind continues to play, reciting lyrics:
“Marky got with Sharon / And Sharon got Sharice / She was sharing Sharon's
outlook / On the topic of disease / Mikey had a facial scar / And Bobby was a
racist / They were all in love with dyin' / They were doing it in Texas.” </p>

<p>01:50. The cursor turns up the volume on the “Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan”
video. The chorus from the music video is audible. The audio recording
continues: “So I’m in this fucking bus with two dozen English teachers. Not
English Professors, who are bad enough, but grizzled boogery middle school and
high school teachers with bad comb-overs and thematic holiday sweaters. . . .”
</p>

<p>02:00 The Davy Crockett video and painted surfing images are rearranged. The
audio recording continues: “Who give you extra credit for bringing them cat food
coupons, and double the credit if they’re worth a free can of icky cat food and
you hope to whatever you deem holy that they do indeed have fifteen cats. . . .”
</p>

<p>02:15 The cursor rearranges the windows on screen to frame the text of the
discussion forum posting, placing the “Widescreen” video and music video in the
foreground at the top of the screen. The cursor turns into a spotlight that
follows the text as the audio recording continues: “And the stories of Mister Whiskers
padding across the new translation of Dostoevsky they are reading religiously
evenings over earl grey that there is a Mister Whiskers and this isn’t a sad,
quiet way of making ends meet because I live in a country that thinks teachers
aren’t professionals and its okay for the Jocks to get the girls and then take
home all the money too because business administration is much more important
than teaching zit-faced kids the importance of being . . . no, too easy a joke. But
you get where that was going, right health class survivors?” </p>

<p>02:52 The cursor brings forward the audio player and presses pause. The
reading of the discussion forum posting stops. The cursor brings a video player
filled with painted surfing imagery mixed with other screen materials to the
front of the screen, blocking out all other windows. The audio from the
“Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan” video can be heard: “Now look what happens if we pan
and scan this. There’s nothing wrong with that as an image. But it’s not the
image that I as a filmmaker wanted you to see. If I wanted to work in this
four-by-three format, I would choose to work in that and have, often, as many
directors have. And directors do wonderful movies in that format, but they know
they are working in that format, so they give you the information that they
think you need in that format.” </p>

<p>03:27 The cursor brings the audio player forward and selects play. The web
browser windows return to the front of the screen. As the video playing the song “Pepper”
moves into the chorus of the song, the recording of the discussion forum posting
continues, following the lyrics: “I don't mind the sun sometimes / The images it
shows / I can taste you on my lips / And smell you in my clothes / Cinnamon and
sugary / And softly spoken lies / You never know just how you look / Through other
people's eyes.” </p>

<p>03:49 In the video “Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier – Part 1,” two
white male figures on horseback cup their hands to their mouths and gesture
toward an owl. Owl sounds are heard in the video. The surfing imagery moves in
and out of the foreground. The audio reading of the discussion forum posting
continues: “And the fucking relentless soundtrack is blaring in my ears,
telling me how I have to get this and that attraction, and that even when I’m
exhausted I can spend more to get rejuvenated to go out and spend yet more
because the hype is all about maximizing the cash flow  while you’re in the
park.” </p>

<p>04:09 In the Davy Crockett video, figures in US cavalry uniforms are seen in
battle with shirtless American Indian figures. The video is mostly blocked from
sight by the video with painted surfing imagery. Gunshots are heard, as is the
cry, “Everybody take cover!” The audio recording continues to play while, on screen, the
text from the forum posting is occasionally spotlighted by the cursor: “And I’m
sitting there thinking about and counting all the hours that it takes to make a
two-day park-hopper pass at $7.75 and hour, listening to not just how much I’ve
just flushed into the rich man’s pockets, but how much more still there is in my
pockets that he (some faceless he – worse to me than Winston’s big man will ever
be to me. . . .” </p>

<p>04:30 The cursor brings the “Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier – Part
1” video forward and turns up the volume slider. Battle sounds and conversation
can be heard. The audio recording continues, as the forum posting is brought
forward again: “Because this dillwad’s actually got his hands in my fucking
pockets taking the cash out, one digit at a time) he, He has every right to do
it, and in my own small way, I’m obligated to bend over and take the rogering
because, well, it was my own damn free will that had me down here in
Baudrillard's back yard, watching vultures (how appropriate) taking a rest on
their commute to the Yucatan.” </p>

<p>05:00 The cursor brings forward the “Pepper” music video and scrubs the
playhead backwards to the 02:15 mark. In the video appear two figures acting out an
old-west shooting scene. The audio recording of the discussion forum posting
continues, parroting the lyrics: “Some will die in hot pursuit / And fiery auto
crashes / Some will die in hot pursuit / While sifting through my ashes / Some will
fall in love with life / And drink it from a fountain / That is pouring like an
avalanche / Coming down the mountain.’” </p>

<p>05:15 The audio recording of the discussion forum posting stops. The music
video becomes more audible. The figure speaking in the “Widescreen vs. Pan &
Scan” video can be heard: “If a director chooses to tell a story for whatever
reason in this ratio, because they want all this information, it’s not fair for
somebody else to tell you with our name on it, that this is what we shot.” </p>

<p>05:30 Battle sounds and screaming can be heard in the Davy Crockett video. The figure in the “Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan”
video continues, his face visible in a close up: “I didn’t shoot that.” The
cursor brings forward the “Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier – Part 1” video.
In the video US cavalry figures and a figure on horseback point rifles at
American Indians holding bows. Gunshot are heard. An American Indian figure
falls from a cliff ledge as the cursor selects pause on the video. The cursor
fades out the sound on the “Pepper” video. The cursor minimizes all the
materials on screen. The video ends.

  <p>Jason Loan's "Tooling with Ambient Response" http://vimeo.com/35816842 extends the boundaries of this
  video with its connection to earlier projects. Uploaded to Vimeo (Jan
  28th, 2012) three days before the initial experiments with <em>Screenshots</em>, Loan's piece itself is
  a crystalization of several months of video exchange between Loan and the
  author. </p>
  <p> The discussion forum posting by Michael Salvo is also a core element of the
  video. Acting as a respondent to HASTAC's publication of a collection of
  materails on sound, Salvo experiments with the form of the academic response,
  weaving sound into the prose via song lyrics and striking a tone that might be
  cast as cynical, irritated, or resistant. This posting has been read aloud by the
  video author, and then incorporated into the performance as an audio file.

  The  videos,  "Butthole Surfers - Pepper," "Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan," and "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier -
  Part 1," were all played directly from the web during the live performance of the piece.

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> In such conditions, my eyes no longer "know"
where to look. The media experiencer can no longer be figured as "spectator,"
standing apart from and overlooking a homogenous visual field. Rather, he or she
must parse multiple, windowed image sources as rhythmic patterns and as
information fields. <span class="attribution">Steven Shaviro, <strong>Post Cinematic Affect</strong> (79)</span></aside>

<p>This video is a recording of a live performance that manipulated media materials
on the screen. The materials include multiple browser and
media windows, so that the final compilation includes lots of edges and
adjustments as windows are arranged. The occasion for the piece emerged in
part by encountering the video clip, "Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan," in which Sydney
Pollack warns against reformating widescreen films to four-by-three formats. Concurrently,
a piece called <em>Feel the Noise: Sound, Music, & Technology</em> was published on the
HASTAC web site. Michael Salvo, as a respondent to the piece, composed the text
that is used in the video. On the evening of January 31st, 2012 and the
afternoon and evening of February 8th, 2012, multiple improvisation and draft
mixes were performed. The performance on February 8th recorded at 9:09PM is the
final capture. The video was uploaded to Vimeo on May 17th 2012.</p>

<p>In <em>Ambient Rhetoric</em>, Thomas Rickert points out that "the boundaries
between brain and body, self and world, language and thought, beginning and end,
are permeable" (100). Like Gregory Ulmer, Jacques Derrida, and Julia Kristeva
today and Plato long ago, Rickert explores a sense of place that develops through the concept
of chora. In this formulation, place is not a
call for "presence" but a contextual means of engaging the material world. "It
includes the background by means of which things show up as what they are" (55).
The boundaries are permeable, so the "background recedes, or withdraws, even as
it generates." This sense of place is, for Rickert, not fully commensurate with
familiar modes of representation. Following Derrida, Rickert notes that the
concept "disrupts representation itself (and hence rhetoric, too, if it is
conceived in terms of symbolicity) even while it remains fundamental for the
passage of representation" (55). </p>

<p>Boundaries can't be easily fixed," Rickert tells us, "as spatial or choric
knowledge has a performative dimension . . . that replaces (or, better, reworks)
the fixed places of topic invention" (71).  <em>Screenshots</em> includes a
video in which Sydney Pollock notes the differing compositional strategies a
director might deploy depending on screen format. A wide format, for instance,
shifts aspects of film time, as the director "can tell much more story faster
with all of that space to use." Pollock seeks to regain control of film
information. <em>Screenshots</em> works with and against this impulse as it
mixes materials within the frame of the computer screen. Here, however, we're
working with multiple windows arranged within the screen. Ann Friedburg notes
the fundamental shift from cinema with its "single image within a single frame"
(2) to computer desktop where "a text or image in one 'window' meets other texts
or images in other 'windows'" (2). Representation shifts as concerns like
opacity, arrangement, layering, and duration play out within the composing
frame. The computer screen's "overlay of 'windows'--open to different
applications for word-processing, Web browsing, emailing,
downloading--transforms the screen surface into a page with deep virtual reach
to archives and databases, indexed and accessible with barely the stroke of a
finger" (19).  </p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The desktop metaphor implies background and
foreground layers. . . . The computer user may switch back and forth between
these layers, open and close "windows," switch activities at will. The user may
not be able to see each "window" in the stack on the desktop, but this doesn't
mean the program isn't there or is no longer active. <span

</span></aside>

<p>Erin Manning and Brian Massumi take up the relationship between framing and
invention as they articulate an approach to scholarship developed around
"research-creation." They note that traditional research "functions predictably
in a bounded frame and lends itself to reproduction." Research-creation,
alternatively, develops through an "emergent process, dedicated to the singular
occurrence of the new, [that] agitates inventively in an open field" (93).
Research-creation requires paradigms "of conditioning, rather than framing. The
difference is that conditioning consists in bringing co-causes into interaction"
(93). Rather than rigid frames we find conditions of possibility such that
"technical objects are co-constitutive of experimental process" (Relationscapes 88).</p>


<p>Switching to "conditioning, rather than framing" offers a renewed mode of
understanding something like screen format for composers. Manning and Massumi
point out that, even during interactions between research-creators and their
environments, "enabling constraints" are needed. "An enabling constraint is
positive in its dynamic effect, even though it may be limiting in its form/force
narrowly considered" (93). The frame becomes less a means of keeping information
in or out and more a material resistance that enables creators to productively
shape materials as part of "an
associated milieu of body-movement-machine whereby new conditions for
experimentation are invented" (88). </p>
