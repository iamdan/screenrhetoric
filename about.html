    <h1>About the Project</h1>
</header>


<p>The materials collected here are offered to test the proposition that, as
academic work expands into video formats, it can challenge behaviors based on
print and open alternative possibilities for scholarship. The tensions in this
proposition derive in part from the significant extents to which print
publication has shaped our understanding of scholarship. Witness the countless
claims for the disruption of new media made in hard-bound books. Print-centric
approaches no doubt provide powerful ways of capturing and sharing knowledge.
They also shape what counts as understanding. If, as Gregory Ulmer suggests,
"print favors and supports or augments an analytical mode of thought" (140),
then alternative modes may be opened up as we move beyond words.</p>



<p>Each page opens with a video that represents aspects of video scholarship and
screen composing. A short discussion follows with information about the creation
of the video and exploration of thematic and rhetorical concerns. The discussion
is not meant to replicate the intellectual concerns taken up in the video. Nor
is it intended to explain the videos or justify their value. Rather, the text is
meant to extend the alt-scholarship impulses of the project. These impulses aim
not for closure, but for opening up meaning by adding intellectual layers
that create resonances or initiate circuits for more exploration. </p>

  <p>Each page also includes a transcript of the video. These transcripts
  provide another means of engaging the videos through textual descriptions.
  These descriptions shed light on a range of questions regarding accessibility
  and video scholarship. The questions can be evoked by comparing a transcript
  from a more traditional, talking head video  with one derived from a screen
  composition. Providng dialog or narration can be accomplished with captions or
  a basic transcript that tracks easily with the temporal progression of the
  video. Compare that with this transcription of four seconds of the audiovisual activity from the video, <em>Waves</em>.

  <blockquote>[01:00] A red electic guitar appears in the video playing in the
  web browser window in the top-left of the screen. The guitar plays in the
  audio track (light, regular picking of strings). The audio from Welcome to
  Pinepoint plays in the background (steady organ sounds). Someone speaking:
  “backspace 10.” The text editing file and the video containing blue sky are
  moved simultaneously to the left, then separated. The title of the video with
  blue sky is now visible: “this is not a blog post.mov.” The Safari browser
  windows are hidden. The Chrome browser window fills the screen. It is
  partially covered by the text editor window toward the top-right quadrant of
  the screen. The Chrome browser window (with the Pinepoint project) contains a
  collage image that layers a painted rendering of mountains (top), trees
  (middle), and ground (front) over a photograph of a landscape with grass and
  sky. The collage image also contains cutouts of figures, a large American car
  from the 1070s, and a water tower. Over the image an “Intro” button appears in
  the lower left-hand corner along with links that read “Start Over |About This
  Project |Credits | Related NFB Films | Contact.” A button also appears on the
  right-hand side of the image that reads, “NEXT.”  The cursor clicks in the
  text editor window. A dialog box appears and Paste is selected. On the Chrome
  browser window, the NEXT button is clicked. Text is pasted into the text
  editor window.<br />

Providing this level of detail, however, reveals the accessibility challenges
associated with screen composing. Descriptions of visual and sonic material, on
one level, seek to provide access to video content. However, reproducing the
experience in a textual mode is not only impractical but also in many ways
incommensurate with enabling people with differing abilities to engage the work.
The three second video segment transcribed above, for instance, requires one
minute and fourty-two seconds to process with a screen reader. Further,
editorial decisions increase exponentially as items in the sonic and visual
field are identified for inclusion in the transcript, and then translated into
textual form. The transcriptions included with the project, seek a balance
between providing access to spoken, written, sonic, and visual materials, while
recgonizing the challenges of delivering video scholarship in textual registers.</p>

<p>Finally, each page includes information about the materials and sources used
in the videos. As with accessibility, our understanding of scholarly uses of
materials is recast through video scholarship and screen composing. A number of
intellectual property questions can be explored by imagining this use in terms
of the multiple factors that go into decisions about the use of materials in
multimodal compositions. </p>

<p>The central components of the project are images, sounds, and text gathered
from the internet. In many cases, these are excerpted and integrated into the
videos in typical scholarly fashion. In some cases, materials are used in their
entirety, evoking considerations related to amounts of materials used in a
project. In some instances, entire texts are used, but not fully integrated into
the composition--as in whole blog postings used to perform machine operations on
texts. In other cases, significant portions of materials are used; however,
their full presence never appears on screen as windows are stacked, arranged,
made transparent, or hidden on screen. </p>

<p>At this point, we need to think through the difference between simply copying
and displaying materials and deliberately integrating them into an intellectual project to make a
point; the mashing together of entire blog postings in <em>Waves</em> conveys
the message of printcentricity; the sounds of the introduction of a live
performance in <em>Trainsplaing</em> prepare the ground for the affective
arguments that will be offered by speeding trains. The selections of material
and their integration among the numerous other artifacts and layers in the
videos is performed critically and creatively with the aim of moving
conversations about scholarship toward screen composing.</p>

<p>Further, we need to consider the ways in which screen composing is an operation that renders
the materials in a new way. In these instances, the new composition is a remix,
nothing at all like the originals. Any item within any of the videos makes up a small portion of the whole experience, as the
materials that are on screen at any given moment are layered together with
browser and media windows, performances, citations, narration, and screen activities that make up the
rest of the project. Whatever materials are used are transformed by
mixing them with multiple other sources. </p>


<p>In all of the videos, materials are deeply integrated and linked with the
messages of the text. Given that the U.S. Copyright office describes
"transformative uses [as] those that add something new, with a further purpose
or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work,"
the materials woven into the project serve a transformative purpose. They evoke
particular points about their given subjects and further the overall message
about alternative approaches to scholarly response. Given the key role of
materials in furthering critical intellectual conversations and their
transformative integration into the videos, the project follows familiar
scholarly protocols of quotation with attribution.</p>

<p>The videos collected here range from speculative experiments in writing
through affective media to audiovisual expositions of scholarly topics to
concrete reports on class activities.  Spending time with several of the videos
will reveal audiovisual resonances, common screen composing techniques, and
thematic connections. The arrangement of the videos in the project menus is not
meant to imply a proper viewing order. The collection is meant to be sampled.
That said, there is a chronology to the development of the pieces and
commonalities among the video. The arrangements below provide additional details
that might be helpful for navigation and one possible way of grouping items.</p>

<hr>
<p>The project highlights  concerns with academic knowledge production.
Scholarship, Rita Felski notes, is often "a mode of interpretation that adopts a
distrustful attitude toward texts." This attitude translates into criticism
"with distinct qualities: distance rather than closeness; guardedness rather
than openness; aggression rather than submission; superiority rather than
reverence" (#). A number of dangers accompany these mind-sets.


Foremost is the
foregoing of compassion and empathy as scholars compete with one another for
intellectual recognition. Many of the videos lay out these concerns, and then offer varied alternative modes of response.</p>

As concerning as the suspicious nature of some scholarship are the ways that
familiar behaviors make it difficult to recognize new modes. Erin Manning and
Brian Massumi warn that disciplines tend to reject "transversal modes of
thought" in favor of "a static organization of preformed categories" (#). Given
the poststructural movements of contemporary theories of knowledge, the
traditional channels seem an arbitrary and fixed mode for developing and sharing
scholarship. Joanna Drucker and Bethany Noviskie offer an alternative in methods
that "go beyond descriptive, generative, or predictive approaches to become
speculative" (#). Drucker and Noviskie ask us to bring speculative and
experimental modes to computing, but the directive can just as easily be applied
to scholarship. Many of the videos respond to this call.</p>

<p>Video scholarship also offers insights into familiar conceptual topics
questions. Through narration, the integration of citations, and the
representations offered by audiovisual materials, the project explores scholarly
topics. Models of thinking based on networks or systems are particularly suited
for theorizing, as the windows and activities of screen composing have "a deep
virtual reach to archives and databases" (Friedman 19). Echoing claims made for
hypertext, networked and autopoetic theories are actualized in the circuits  of
screen composing. Bruno Latour tells us, "go with the flow . . . follow the
circulating entities" (237). The videos experiment with emergent materialities
and networked modes as they take up scholarly topics. </p>

<p>The concerns of video scholarship also reshape activities in the classroom.
The pedagogical approaches promoted in the project bring into sharp relief the
printcentric orientations of academic work. Ian Bogost identifies the most
significant fixture of traditional scholarship as writing, and asks "must
scholarly productivity take written form?" (89). Typcial assignments ask
students to "fix meaning and erect solutions" (Davis 252). Inviting students to
compose for the screen involves them with practices that foreground
extralinguistic meaning, emergence, affect, and ambiguity. Familiar expectations
might find students studying works rich with irreconcilable complexity and open
questions; however, any hint of such ambiguity in student responses is to be
eliminated in any responses students might create. Many of the videos collected
here explore the implications of opening composition activities to the movements
of screen composing.</p>
