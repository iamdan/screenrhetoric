    <h1>About the Project</h1>
</header>


<p>
    The materials here suggest that as academic work expands into video
    formats, it recasts behaviors based on print. The tensions in this
    proposition, in part, arise from the influence that print publication has
    had on our sense of scholarship. Consider the countless claims for digital
    disruption made in hardbound books. Print-oriented approaches provide
    powerful ways of capturing and sharing knowledge. They also shape what
    counts as understanding. If, as Gregory Ulmer suggests, "print favors and
    supports or augments an analytical mode of thought" (140), then moving
    beyond words will open up alternative possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Each chapter starts with a video made through screen composing. These
    videos include elements found in academic work. Activities like excerpting
    a source to provide a quotation appear as displays of texts, typing on
    screen, and voice narration. The videos also deploy movement, visuals, and
    sounds, pushing past some of the communicative possibilities of prose and
    print. These combinations challenge conceptions of reading and scholarship.
    The videos range along a continuum that starts with, on one end,
    recognizable academic forms and leads to, on the other, speculative modes
    linked with mixed media and screens. A video like <em>Bridges Sing</em>
    provides a narrative track, excerpts of texts, and reports on class
    activities that make the viewing experience reasonably familiar. A video
    like <em>Waves</em>, on the other hand, captures cutting and pasting blocks
    of text to make implicit points. Videos in varying amounts exhibit
    decipherability, scholarly gestures, affective sounds, visual layerings,
    and ambiguity—to name a few aspects. This continuum bridges familiar and
    alternative modes of scholarship and print and screen composing.
</p>
<p>
    Chapters also include Discussion segments that connect the videos with
    scholarly and rhetorical concerns. The discussion is meant to further
    bridge print and digital composing by linking the videos with intellectual
    issues. These connections extend the alt-scholarship impulses of the
    project. The discussion aims not for closure, but for opening up meaning by
    adding conceptual layers that evoke resonances, initiate circuits, or
    provide pathways for more exploration.
</p>
<p>
    Each chapter also includes Transcripts with background information and a
    prose translation of the video. The videos themselves include captions of
    audio and descriptions of visual elements. Together, the captions,
    descriptions, and transcripts improve access even as they raise questions.
    How can we augment the limited dialog and sounds typically found in
    captions? How should visual descriptions operate in combination with
    captions? How directly should descriptions seek to reproduce the experience
    of the videos? And how do transcripts extend and expand on video materials?
    The rich transcripts are key components of the project. As they rework spoken, written, 
    sonic, and visual materials, they provide additional insights into video scholarship 
    and a space for speculation on relationships between print and screen.
</p>
<p>
    Information about materials and sources is also included in each chapter.
    The central components of the project are images, sounds, and texts
    gathered from the internet and from academic sources. In many cases, these
    are excerpted and integrated into the videos in typical scholarly fashion.
    In some cases, whole texts are copied, but not directly integrated into the
    composition—as in blog postings used to perform machine operations on
    texts. In other cases, significant portions of materials are used; however,
    their full presence never appears in the final piece, since windows are
    stacked, arranged, made transparent, or hidden on screen.
</p>
<p>
    The purposes associated with the videos are similar to those behind
    scholarship in print. Images, sounds, and texts are integrated among one
    another to move forward conversations and explore intellectual concerns.
The inclusion of entire blog postings in <em>Waves</em> conveys the message of printcentricity; a live musical performance
    in <em>Trainsplaining</em> prepares the ground for the affective, sonic
    arguments that will be delivered by speeding trains. Both videos deploy
    materials to offer commentary, teach concepts, and share scholarly
    response.
</p>
<p>
    Screen composing also renders materials in ways that are nothing at all
    like their original sources. Any item brings a portion to the whole
    experience, since materials are layered together with browser and media
    windows, performances, citations, narration, and screen activities. The
    sources are transformed through mixing. The US Copyright Office describes
    "transformative uses [as] those that add something new, with a further
    purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use
    of the work." Because it extends the ways we compose, video scholarship transforms materials as it mixes artifacts to explore ideas.
</p>

<h4>Affirming, Speculating, Theorizing, and Teaching</h4>

<p>The videos range from experiments in screen composing to audiovisual
    expositions of scholarly topics to reports on class activities. The
    arrangement of the chapters is not meant to imply a proper viewing
    sequence. If desired, you can sample chapters in any order. Spending time
    with several of the videos will reveal material resonances, common
    techniques, and thematic connections. The arrangements below suggest some
    of these connections and one possible way of grouping items.
</p>

<h5>Affirming</h5>

<p>The project highlights aspects of academic communication. Scholarship, Rita
    Felski notes, is often "a mode of interpretation that adopts a distrustful
    attitude toward texts." This attitude translates into "distance rather than
    closeness; guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than
    submission; superiority rather than reverence" (Suspicious Minds, 222). A
    number of concerns accompany these mind-sets. Foremost is the loss of
    compassion and empathy as scholars compete with one another for
    intellectual recognition. Many of the videos lay out these concerns, and then offer alternative, affirmative modes of response.</p>

            logic; decipherability and ambiguity</p>

        </figure></a>
        </li>
  </ul>

<h5>Speculating</h5>

<p>


Familiar behaviors make it difficult to recognize new modes. Erin Manning
    and Brian Massumi warn that disciplines tend to reject "transversal modes
    of thought" in favor of "a static organization of preformed categories"
    (30). Given our networked and emergent contemporary theories of knowledge,
    the traditional channels seem an overly fixed mode for scholarship. Johanna
    Drucker and Bethany Noviskie suggest we "go beyond descriptive, generative,
    or predictive approaches to become speculative." Henri Bergson finds in
    speculation the importance of opening a problem "even more than of solving
it" (36–37). The videos evoke these processes of uncovering. </p>

           and then settle again as sediment</p>

          </figcaption>
      </figure></a>
      </li>
</ul>


<h5>Theorizing</h5>


<p>Through narration, the integration of citations, and sonic and visual
    materials, the project offers insights into familiar conceptual questions.
    Theories based on networks or systems are instantiated in the windows and
    activities of the screen, which have "a deep virtual reach to archives and
    databases" (Friedman, 19). Intertextuality, posthumanism, and emergence are
    captured in the composing. Bruno Latour tells us to "go with the flow . . .
    follow the circulating entities" (237). The videos experiment with this directive as they take up scholarly topics. </p>

<ul class="about-photo-grid">

          data in culture and scholarly research. Highlights the balance to be

        <p>Drawing on the proposition that when creativity loses
        its novelty, it seeks out new channels,
        the video offers the Mac and PC characters of Apple's "Get a Mac" advertising
        campaign as models for metaphor in the realm of the screen</p>

               The piece deploys sonic and visual materials that offer an argument not about but <em>through</em> affect</p>

          </figcaption>
      </figure></a>
      </li>
</ul>

<h5>Teaching</h5>

<p>Screen composing reshapes activities in the classroom. And students are
    capable creators of video scholarship. These projects extend printcentric
    orientations of academic work. Ian Bogost notes that scholarly "obsession
    with writing creates numerous problems" (89) and asks, "Must scholarly
    productivity take written form?" Diane Davis tells us that typical
    assignments require students to "fix meaning and erect solutions" (252).
    Video scholarship features extralinguistic meaning, emergence, affect, and ambiguity—qualities traditionally edited
    out of student work. Many of the videos explore the implications of opening classroom activities to video scholarship and screen composing.</p>

          and media while reflecting on historical moments at the intersections of computers
          and composition. The piece suggests that composing against the grain of software can reveal the materiality of

<hr>
<p>I would like to thank the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative for
    their support. Without their efforts, the project would not exist. For all
    pathways opened, thanks to Cheryl Ball, Doug Eyman, and all those
    associated with the journal <em>Kairos</em> and Kairos Camp. Deep thanks to
    the many students who have been trusting enough to explore the
    possibilities of screen composing and share their work. Special thanks to
    the colleagues who have offered feedback and guidance over the years: to
    Jason Loan for the numerous "video conversations" that pushed the
    speculative potential of the screen; to Adam Engel for sharing the joy of
    video poetry; to Ashley Hall and to Jennifer Ware for their ongoing
    collaboration and inspiration. Thanks to Carly Schnitzler and Sarah Walton
    for the insightful feedback and assistance with the project. Deepest thanks to
    Cindy, Peter, and Palmer Anderson for making it all meaningful. In memory of Roger Yates Anderson.
