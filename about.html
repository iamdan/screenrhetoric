    <h1>About the Project</h1>
</header>


<p>The materials collected here test the proposition that, as
academic work expands into video formats, it can challenge behaviors based on
print and open alternative possibilities for scholarship. The tensions in this
proposition derive in part from the ways that print
publication has shaped our sense of scholarship. Witness the countless
claims for digital disruption made in hard-bound books. Print-centric
approaches provide powerful ways of capturing and sharing knowledge.
They also determine what counts as understanding. If, as Gregory Ulmer suggests,
"print favors and supports or augments an analytical mode of thought" (140),
then alternative modes of thinking may be opened up as we move beyond words.</p>



<p>Each page opens with a video that represents aspects of video scholarship and
screen composing. A short discussion follows with information about the creation
of the video and exploration of scholarly and rhetorical concerns. The discussion
is not meant to replicate the messages offered in the videos. Nor
is it intended to explain the videos. Rather, the text extends the alt-scholarship impulses of the project. These impulses aim
not for closure, but for opening up meaning by adding intellectual materials
that create layers, evoke resonances, initiate circuits, or open pathways for more exploration. </p>

<h4>Transcripts</h4>

  <p>Each page also includes a transcript of the video. These transcripts
  provide a means of engaging the videos through textual descriptions.
  These descriptions shed light on a range of questions regarding accessibility
  and video scholarship. Providing transcripts of monologue, dialog, or narration is relatively
  straightforward when words are delivered through video.
 Compare that with this transcription of twenty-five seconds of the audiovisual activity from the video, <em>Waves</em>.

  <blockquote>02:08 In the text box, the copied opening paragraph of the NYTimes.com
  article is visible: “This is a blog. There, I’ve said it. . . .”  In the
  Chrome browser window with the “Welcome to Pine Point" project, the animated
  bird grasps a piece of yarn in its beak and flies off, dragging new imagery
  onto the screen, including a scan of a flyer with a line drawing of a figure
  in a welder’s mask. At the top of the screen is a label that reads: Ads from
  Pinepoint Yearbooks. In the text editor window, the cursor deletes text until
  the phrase, "We seek tr" remains. The run button is clicked, and “tr” becomes
  traditional. The Run button is clicked, and “traditional” becomes transform.
  The cursor at the end of transform begins typing, and transform become
  transformation. From the "Welcome to Pinepoint" project, a voice begins to
  speak: “I don’t think I’ve ever had closure with Pine Point. I always. I
  always feel sad when I, like you said, when I tell somebody I grew up in Pine
  Point and they ask me when do I come back. I go, Oh, it’s not there anymore.’
  And I do feel a sense of, I don’t know what it is. For me it’s weird to say
  that I don’t have. . . .”<br />
  [02:33]
</blockquote>

Providing this level of detail reveals the accessibility challenges
associated with screen composing. Can descriptions of visual and sonic material reproduce the
experience of the videos in a textual mode?
The twenty-five second video segment transcribed above requires one
minute and twenty-four seconds to process with a screen reader. Creative decisions increase exponentially as items in the sonic and visual
fields are identified for inclusion in the transcript, and then translated into
textual form. The transcriptions included with the project seek a balance
between providing access to spoken, written, sonic, and visual materials, while
recognizing the challenges of delivering video scholarship in textual registers.</p>

<h4>Materials and Sources</h4>

<p>Each page also includes information about the materials and sources used in
the videos. A number of intellectual property questions are recast in terms of
media and networked knowledge as materials are deployed in video scholarship and
screen composing. </p>

<p>The central components of the project are images, sounds, and texts gathered
from the internet. In many cases, these are excerpted and integrated into the
videos in typical scholarly fashion. In some cases, materials are used in their
entirety, evoking considerations related to amounts of materials used in a
project. In some instances, entire texts are used, but not fully integrated into
the composition--as in whole blog postings used to perform machine operations on
texts. In other cases, significant portions of materials are used; however,
their full presence never appears on screen as windows are stacked, arranged,
made transparent, or hidden on screen. </p>

<p>The purposes associated with video scholarship also recast questions about
using materials. The selections of images, sounds, and texts and their
integration among the numerous other artifacts and layers in the videos is
performed critically and creatively with the aim of moving conversations about
scholarship toward screen composing. These combinations are made to offer
criticism, commentary, teaching, and scholarly response. The mashing together of
entire blog postings in <em>Waves</em> conveys the message of printcentricity;
the sounds of the introduction of a live performance in <em>Trainsplaining</em>
prepare the ground for the affective arguments that will be offered by speeding
trains. The formats differ, but their deployment for scholarly purposes
resonates with familiar academic uses of materials.</p>

<p>In the creation of video scholarship, screen composing also renders materials
in new ways. In these instances, the new composition creates remixes in which
materials are made to be nothing at all like the originals. Any item within any
of the videos makes up a small portion of the whole experience, as the materials
that are on screen at any given moment are layered together with browser and
media windows, performances, citations, narration, and screen activities. The
materials are transformed by deliberately mixing them with multiple other
sources. The US Copyright office describes "transformative uses [as] those that
add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not
substitute for the original use of the work." Through recombinations, materials
are remade in ways that surpass simple representation.

<h4>Affirming, Speculating, Theorizing, and Teaching</h4>

<p>The videos collected here range from experiments in screen composing to
audiovisual expositions of scholarly topics to concrete reports on class
activities.  Spending time with several of the videos will reveal audiovisual
resonances, common techniques, and thematic connections. The
arrangement of the videos in the project menus is not meant to imply a proper
viewing order. The collection is meant to be sampled. That said, there is a
chronology to the development of the pieces and commonalities among the videos.
The arrangements below provide additional details that might be helpful for
navigation and one possible way of grouping items.</p>

<h5>Affirming</h5>

<p>The project highlights  concerns with academic knowledge production.
Scholarship, Rita Felski notes, is often "a mode of interpretation that adopts a
distrustful attitude toward texts." This attitude translates into criticism characterized by
"distance rather than closeness; guardedness rather
than openness; aggression rather than submission; superiority rather than
reverence" (222). A number of dangers accompany these mindsets.


Foremost is the
loss of compassion and empathy as scholars compete with one another for
intellectual recognition. Many of the videos lay out these concerns, and then offer alternative, affirmative modes of response.</p>

            logic; decidability and ambiguity</p>

              <p>Responds to the claim that digital humanities creates meaning "produced not by anyone but by everyone in
                concert" (Fish). The video highlights the ways that print biases permeate scholarly defenses of this vision</p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure></a>
        </li>
  </ul>

<h5>Speculating</h5>

<p>


Familiar behaviors make it difficult to recognize new modes. Erin Manning and
Brian Massumi warn that disciplines tend to reject "transversal modes of
thought" in favor of "a static organization of preformed categories" (30). Given
the poststructural movements of contemporary theories of knowledge, the
traditional channels seem an arbitrary and fixed mode for developing and sharing
scholarship. Joanna Drucker and Bethany Noviskie offer an alternative in methods
that "go beyond descriptive, generative, or predictive approaches to become
speculative." Drucker and Noviskie ask us to bring speculative modes to computing, but the directive can just as easily be applied
to scholarship. Many of the videos respond to this call.</p>

          several windows simultaneously while flooding  audio channels with
          multiple sources of sound.

            <p>Reflects on conceptions of memory and time. Geologic processes are linked with "loops" through which time is
           recast into "durations." Videos from prior projects resurface, are repurposed,
           and then settle again as sediment</p>

          </figcaption>
      </figure></a>
      </li>
</ul>


<h5>Theorizing</h5>


<p>Video scholarship also offers insights into familiar conceptual
questions. Through narration, the integration of citations, and the
representations offered by audiovisual materials, the project articulates perspectives on scholarly
topics. Models of thinking based on networks or systems are particularly suited
for such theorizing, as the windows and activities of screen composing have "a deep
virtual reach to archives and databases" (Friedman 19). Echoing claims made for
hypertext, networked and autopoetic theories are actualized in the circuits  of
screen composing. Bruno Latour tells us, "go with the flow . . . follow the
circulating entities" (237). The videos experiment with this directive as they take up scholarly topics. </p>

          struck between database and narrative, actualizing these two impulses through dialog and evoking

        <p>Drawing on the proposition that, when metaphor loses
        its novelty, it seeks out new channels,
        the video offers the Mac and PC characters of Apple's "Get a Mac" advertising
        campaign as models for metaphor in the realm of the screen</p>

               The piece deploys sonic and visual materials that offer an argument not about but <em>through</em> affect</p>

          </figcaption>
      </figure></a>
      </li>
</ul>

<h5>Teaching</h5>

<p>Video scholarship reshapes activities in the classroom.
The pedagogical approaches promoted in the project bring into sharp relief the
printcentric orientations of academic work. Ian Bogost identifies the most
significant fixture of traditional scholarship as writing, and asks "must
scholarly productivity take written form?" (89). Typical assignments ask
students to "fix meaning and erect solutions" (Davis 252). Inviting students to
compose for the screen foregrounds
extralinguistic meaning, emergence, affect, and ambiguity--qualities traditionally edited out of student work. Many of the videos collected
here explore the implications of opening classroom activities to the movements
of video scholarship and screen composing.</p>

            <span class="caption-topic">Watch the Bubble (2011)</span>
          <p>Blends memoir, manifesto,
          and media while reflecting on historical moments at the intersections of computers
          and composition. The piece suggests that composing against the grain of software can reveal the materiality of
          the screen</p>

          <span class="caption-topic">Casting Learning (2011)</span>
        <p>Reports on videos
        developed in an undergraduate literature class. The piece argues that audiovisual
        composing projects involve risk on the parts of students,
        and deliver corresponding payoffs in motivation and creativity</p>

            critical response to the poem, "The Red Wheelbarrow." The response also explores
            approaches to teaching composition, highlighting academic fixation on the essay and calling for more imagination</p>

<hr>
<p>I would like to thank the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative for their  support. Without their efforts and
encouragement, the project would not exist. Thanks as well to the many students
who have been trusting enough to explore the possibilities of
screen composing with me. Special thanks to the colleagues who have offered
feedback and guidance over the years: to Jason Loan for the numerous "video
conversations" that have pushed the project to explore the speculative
potential of video; to Adam Engel for sharing the joy of bringing poetry to the screen; to Ashley Hall for helping to discover the
possibilities of video in the classroom and for inspiration; to Jennifer
Ware for bringing to light the important methodologies of screen composing.
Thanks to Sarah Walton for the insightful feedback and assistance with the
project. And thanks beyond all to Cindy, Peter, and Palmer Anderson for their
endless inspiration and support.
