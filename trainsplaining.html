    This video was performed at the 2014 Computers and Writing Conference as
    part of a panel on new media and scholarly criticism. It brings together
    several video clips, scanned images from scholarly articles and books, live
    typing, sound effects, and scrolling quotations. The version here was
    recorded on June 10, 2014 and adds thumbnail footage of the author
    performing captured by the laptop camera.
</p>
<p>
    While the piece contains traditional academic excerpts, its points are, for
    the most part, implicit. Often passages are placed on screen, and then a
    cursor spotlight is used to draw attention to some aspect of the excerpts.
    There are also segments that show live typing in a text document. The
    primary approach is to deliver claims related to affect through performance
    by cycling among video clips that contain music, imagery, and sonic
    elements.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

  <p>
    00:00 The video opens with media items arrayed in four quadrants of the
    screen: in the lower left, a video clip shows a live concert performance by
    the band Ducktails; in the lower right, a clip of an owl on a tree limb; in
    the upper right, a clip of a train waiting to cross a highway; in the upper
    left, a browser window with an excerpt of a scholarly article. A small
    window that shows the narrator, filmed sitting somewhere outside, appears
    in the bottom right corner. The sound of owls can be heard. The cursor
    clicks the play button on the Ducktails live performance video and the band
    prepares to play. The cursor clicks play on several other videos. The sound
    of a shaker can be heard. The sound of owls can be heard. The sound of
    train-crossing bells can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    00:43 The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights a phrase in the
    article: "Digitality provides new haunts, new places for the spectral
    traces and strands of communication, figuration, and affect to circulate."
    The band, beginning to perform, eases into the song; a shaker can be heard
    beneath soft keyboards. Owls hoot. A steady ringing bell from a train
    crossing can be heard softly. Train horns can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    01:09 The cursor clicks the right side of the screen and a long, thin video
    jumps to the front of the clips. The thin video is partially transparent
    and contains text that scrolls from right to left: "Engelbart's demo
    included the first public use of a mouse, and the sight of its pointer . .
    . sweeping across the screen instantly collapsed the stark input/output
    rhythms of batch-process and . . . command-line computing into a single,
    continuous sweep of user activity." A train horn can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    01:35 The cursor moves to the top of the screen and brings forward a window
    with a text file. The transparency of the window is increased so that the
    typing is opaque and layered over the video of the train. The cursor begins
    to type: "The train is on the tracks. / But look how slowly it pulls from
    the station." The train in the video finishes crossing a highway and begins
    to pick up speed. The band in the performance video eases into the song.
    Soft keyboard sounds can be heard. A bass drum and a bass guitar are heard
    occasionally.
</p>
<p>
    02:04 The cursor moves to the left side of the screen and brings forward
    another video of a train, and then selects play. The cursor brings forward
    the browser window containing the excerpt from a scholarly article. Owls
    can be heard. The sound of train wheels rolling slowly over tracks can be
    heard. The band continues to ease into the song. The browser window is
    reloaded with a new excerpt from another article. The cursor turns into a
    spotlight and highlights several terms in the text of the article:
    "interface, map, contact zone, borders." The cursor highlights a segment of
    a file path in the window with the Ducktails video, revealing the word
    "desktop."
</p>
<p>
    02:48 The cursor moves to the top right and brings a new video clip
    forward, and then selects play. An image of an approaching train appears,
    followed by footage of an empty train track in the snow. The sounds of owls
    can be heard. The sounds of trains and the band can be heard. In the upper
    left, a new excerpt from an article is loaded into the browser window. The
    cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights a phrase: "That is why
    uncomfortable people can often change a system. They can see it" (126).
</p>
<p>
    03:29 A voice over a radio can be heard calling out information about an
    approaching train. A train horn can be heard in the distance. In the clip
    in the upper right, the image is zoomed in to show an approaching train.
    Owls can be heard. The cursor moves to the lower right corner of the screen
    and brings a video clip forward that shows a highway train crossing in
    heavy snow. The intensity of the band playing picks up with the addition of
    a saxophone.
</p>
<p>
    03:44 In the upper left, a new article excerpt is loaded into the browser
    window. The cursor spotlights a phrase: "What performs a critique cannot
    also compose." The cursor brings a video forward in the upper left. In the
    video, two trains on parallel tracks move quickly past a platform. The
    sound of their wheels rolling fast can be heard. In the lower right, the
    gate on the highway train crossing is lowered. The sound of clanging bells
    can be heard.
</p>
<p>
    04:10. The cursor grabs the browser window in the upper left and moves it
    to the lower right of the screen. A new excerpt has been loaded into the
    browser window. It reads: "Rhetoric has a material dimension, and it is an
    embodied and embedded practice. Rhetoric is an emergent result of
    environmentally situated and interactive engagements, redolent of a world
that affects us, that persuades us prior to symbolicity." The sound of a train horn gets
    louder. Guitars are now playing steadily in the song the band is playing
    and a voice is softly singing. A human voice can be heard mimicking the
    train horn. The sounds of several sets of train wheels rolling fast over
    tracks can be heard. In the upper right, the approaching train gets closer.
    The sound of the train horn gets louder (and closer).
</p>
<p>
    04:22 The train horn gets closer and louder. The cursor clicks in the lower
    right and brings the clip with the highway train crossing in snow to the
    front. A freight train zooms past at high speed, spraying snow. In the
    upper right, the approaching train also moves by at high speed. The cursor
    clicks in the upper right and brings forward another long, thin video
    containing a ribbon of text. The text scrolls from right to left: "The
    computer—or more specifically, the screen—had clearly become a much more
    complex representational space, an information space whose surface owed as
    much to modernist collage as it did to brute force calculation." The band
    continues to play with bass guitar, drums, keyboard, and electric guitar
    mixed steadily. The sounds of several sets of train wheels rolling fast
    over tracks can be heard. A human voice can be heard as the train races by,
    spraying snow: "Oh my god."
</p>
<p>
    04:40 The cursor brings the text file forward and begins typing: "We need
    to ask, what comes before (or after) discourse." The band continues to
    play, with the sounds of guitars taking over as the vocals stop. As the
    trains in all windows speed by, the human voice continues: "Oh my god. Holy
    crap. Oh my god. Ohhaah."
</p>
<p>
    05:05 The sounds of several sets of train wheels rolling fast over tracks
    can be heard. The band continues to play. A voice can be heard:
    "Oooaaaaaah. Oh my god. Oaaaaahhhhhh." The cursor moves over the text file,
    and deletes the word "ask." In all capital letters the cursor types FEEL,
    so the phrase now reads: "We need to FEEL what comes before (or after)
    discourse."
</p>
<p>
    05:15 A voice can be heard: "Ooaahahahooaah. Ohhh." The train in the lower
    right finishes moving through the snowy crossing. The sounds of the
    speeding train diminish. A voice can be heard: "Ohhhaha. Nice!" The sound
    of owls can be heard. The cursor brings forward the text file in the top
    right of the screen, then scrolls down to reveal a list of sources. The
    train sounds diminish. Owls can be heard. The cursor moves to the top of
    the screen, opens a drop-down menu, and selects "Stop Recording." The video
    stops.
</p>

 <p>
    The bulk of the materials provide train imagery and sounds. Videos like
    "CRAZY FAST Eastbound CP &amp; SOO Train in Finch," "SUPER RARE! UP
    Freights Race through Fremont," "Vermont Train Chase: Green Mountain Train
    263 -- Fall 2013," and "(VERY VERY VERY FAST) CP
    Stack/Auto with Two Olympic Units!!" have been gathered from numerous
    "train sighting" postings on the YouTube website. Two videos that depict
    owl imagery have also been sampled from the YouTube site.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Trainsplaining</em>
    also includes an excerpt from the video "Pitchfork Presents: Ducktails—The
    Flower Lane Release Party," which depicts a live performance by the band
    Ducktails. The "Intro" segment of the video creates the musical backing
    track. The video also includes scanned materials from scholarly books and
    articles. These are excerpted and displayed as a series of images in a
    browser window. Two quotations are also included in the form of
    right-to-left scrolling video tickers. These ticker videos also include owl
    sounds that are heard regularly as the quotations loop on the screen.

<h4>Discussion</h4>



<aside class="pullquote-right">Affective tides ebb and flow. In their upswell they prefigure emergent,
    far-from equilibrium follow-on movements whose direction is increasingly
    unpredictable. Representation lies among the flotsam and jetsam like a
    weather-beaten plastic bottle. <br><span class="attribution"> Erin
Manning and Brian Massumi, <span class="attribution-title">Thought in Act</span> (16)</span></aside>


<p>
    This piece argues for the value of affect in scholarly communication.
    Affect can challenge traditional academic modes, calling for (or through)
    registers that open rather than close possibilities for meaning. Affective
    scholarship is linked to memory, the body, and creative expression. These
    possibilities can be amplified by media materials. Visuals, sounds, and
    movements that evoke emotions are fixtures of screen composing. Sean Morey
    tells us that "certainly print can evoke emotions, feeling, and mood, but
    not in the same way as visual or tactile forms of delivery" (107).
    Affective approaches add complexity to compositions through channels for
    "sense-data that appears in many digital modes, producing a mood, an
    emotion, but not always making this conscious to the viewer" (53).
</p>
<p>
    Emotional flows vary with modes of delivery. Images, for instance, have an
    affective agency when it comes to moods and feelings. Morey calls on W. J.
    T. Mitchell to point out that "images have both lives and desires" (145).
    Images offer a posthuman placement of affective agency in visual materials,
    making representation through emotional layers an inherent component of
    video scholarship. The challenge is recognizing and balancing our
    expectations. If, as Jody Murray suggests, "images that are ambiguous, that
    defy translation into words, are precisely the kind of images that are
    themselves the most generative, the most non-discursive" (51), then values
    linked with abstraction, decipherability, and ambiguity will shift as we
    recast theorizing through the screen.
</p>
<p>
    One challenge with such recalibrations is measuring affective flows. Bonnie
    Kyburz points out that scholars often turn to qualities of intensity to
    gauge affect. She links this turn to video composing through images that
    "render affective intensities in viewers and producers" (182). These
    intensities can translate into "rhetorical work that circulates toward [a
    new] sort of moving signification" (173). These affective circulations
    challenge our desires for closure as they "happen, glow, disturb, settle,
    brighten, flicker longingly" (159). Desires for closure are traded for
    emerging possibilities as meaning making is linked with physical response.
    At the same time, as Kyburz reminds us, "the fog of indeterminacy need not
    be theorized as lacking critical potential" (165).
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Thought in the Act</em>, Erin Manning and Brian Massumi say we can
    "compose with concepts already on their way in another mode, in the mode of
    artistic practice, in the mode of event-formation, of activism, of dance,
    even of everyday perception" (viii). Composing, they suggest, can create
    "conceptual interference" that reveals unseen patterns. They call for
    performances that reveal "composing across the breach between philosophy
    and art, philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and moving"
    (viii). These performances will span gaps between decipherability and
    uncertainty, deploying varying levels of ambiguity to move back and forth
    among the known and the new. With much of composition, such transformation
    emerges through the mixing of words. The video shows what happens when we
    try the intense eventfulness of speeding trains in heavy snow.
</p>
<p>
    At several points, a video containing a short quotation that scrolls from
    right to left appears. This video snippet was made by typing the words into
    a text editor, and then filming a segment of the screen as the text is
    scrolled horizontally. It's an experimental technique that responds to the
    challenges of moving scholarly citation into video modes. How much text can
    be processed? How to mix language among images and sound? How to move
    between written, spoken, and visual inscriptions of words? So many
    questions for screen composers to consider.

<aside class="pullquote-left">What mobilizes the rigor of a speculative pragmatism therefore cannot be a
    method imposed on the process from without. The rigor must emerge from
    within the occasion of experience, from the event's own stakes in its
    coming-to-be. <span class="attribution"> Erin Manning, <span class="attribution-title">The Minor Gesture</span> (38)</span></aside>

<p>
    The piece brings together four video clips of trains. These clips create
    affective layers punctuated by the sounds of wheels rolling over tracks and
    approaching air horns. Morey tells us that media can deliver emotions and
    feelings, and that these deliveries are ambient and embodied: "Feeling
    bridges a primary emotion with a cognizant recognition of context. Feeling
    can change based on situation or environment" (96). For Morey, emotional
    elements lead to feelings; affect is a kind of material for moving these
    feelings. "Affect provides the current that allows emotions to exist.
    Affective flows can become emotional which then can manifest into feelings"
    (99). "Holy crap," a voice exclaims at 04:45 in the video. The train
    speeding by is obscured by the snow blowing in its wake. Over the sound of
    steel-on-steel coming from the wheels, the voice continues, "Oh my God.
    Ohhaah. Oooaaaaaah."
</p>
<p>
    Emotions, feelings, and affect lead to moods and even to the sublime in
    screen composing. Of course, the model, with terms like current and flows,
    returns us back to metaphor and calls for more language if we are to close
    out the concepts. (Or, perhaps, more media if we are to open them up.) The
    train horn in the performance links environments and moods with feelings,
    adding an element of velocity and situated sound that flows into the
    composition without words. It's what Manning describes as a "knowing [that]
    is incipient to the experience at hand, actively felt but often
    indecipherable in linguistic terms" (37). Affective speculation plays out
    as discursive limits give way to owls and trains.
