  <p>This video includes a variety of video clips, which contain music, imagery
  of trains  and owls, and quotations from scholarly articles. There are also
  segments that show live typing in a text document. </p>

  <p>00:00 The video opens with media items arrayed in four quadrants of the
  screen: in the lower left, a video clip shows a live performance by the band
  DuckTails. On the right side of the screen are clips of an owl and of a train
  waiting to cross a highway, along with a small window that shows the narrator,
  filmed sitting somewhere outside. In the upper left, a browser window shows an
  excerpt of a scholarly article. The cursor clicks the play button on the live performance video
  and the band prepares to play. The cursor clicks play on several other videos. The sound of owls can be heard. </p>

  <p>00:43 The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights a phrase in the
  article: “Digitality provides new haunts, new places for the spectral traces
  and strands of communication, figuration, and affect to circulate.” The band,
  beginning to perform, eases into the song; a shaker can be heard beneath soft
  keyboards. Owls hoot. A steady ringing bell from a train can be heard softly.
  </p>

  <p>01:09 The cursor clicks the right side of the screen and a long, thin
  video jumps to the front of the clips. The thin video is partially transparent
  and contains text that scrolls from right to left that reads: “Engelbart’s
  demo included the first public use of a mouse, and the sight of its pointer . .
  . sweeping across the screen instantly collapsed the stark input/output rhythms
  of batch-process and . . . command-line computing into a single, continuous
  sweep of user activity." A train horn can be heard. </p>

  <p>01:35 The cursor moves to the top of the screen and brings forward a text file and begins to type words overlaid on the video of the train: “The train is on the tracks. / But look how slowly it pulls from the station.” The train in the video finishes crossing a highway and begins to pick up speed.
  </p>

  <p>02:04 The cursor moves to the left side of the screen and brings forward
  another video of a train, and then selects play.  The cursor brings forward the
  browser window containing the excerpt from a scholarly article. The browser
  window is reloaded with a new excerpt from another article. The cursor turns
  into a spotlight and highlights several terms in the text of the article:
  “interface, map, contact zone, borders.” The cursor highlights a segment of a
  file path in one of the videos, revealing the word “desktop.” </p>

  <p>02:48 The cursor moves to the top right and brings a new video clip
  forward, and then selects play. An image of an approaching train appears, followed
  by footage of an empty train track in the snow. The sounds of owls can be
  heard. In the upper-left, a new excerpt from an article is loaded into the
  browser window. The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights the phrase:
  “That is why uncomfortable people can often change a system. They can see it”
  (126). </p>

  <p>03:29 A voice over a radio can be heard calling out information about an
  approaching train. A train horn can be heard in the distance. In the clip in
  the upper right, the image is zoomed in to show an approaching train. The
  cursor moves to the lower-right corner of the screen and brings a video clip
  forward that shows a train crossing in heavy snow. The intensity of the Ducktails
  song picks up with the addition of a saxophone. </p>

  <p>03:44 In the upper-left, a new article excerpt is loaded into the browser window. The cursor spotlights the phrase: “What performs a critique cannot also compose.” The cursor brings a video forward in the upper left. In the video two trains on parallel tracks move quickly past a train platform. The sound of their wheels on the tracks can be heard. In the lower-right, the gate on the train crossing is lowered. The sound of clanging bells can be heard.
  </p>

  <p>04:10. The cursor grabs the browser window in the upper-left and moves it
  to the lower-right of the screen. A new excerpt has been loaded into the
  browser window. The sound of a train horn gets louder. A human voice can be
  heard mimicking the train horn. In the upper-right, the approaching train gets
  closer and closer. The sound of the train horn gets closer. </p>

  <p>04:22 The train horn gets closer and louder. The cursor clicks in the lower
  right and brings the clip with the train crossing in snow to the front. A
  freight train zooms past at high speed, spraying snow. In the upper-right, the
  approaching train also moves by at high speed. The cursor clicks in the
  upper-right and brings forward another long-thin video containing a ribbon of
  text. The text scrolls from right to left and reads: “The computer—or more
  specifically, the screen—had clearly become a much more complex
  representational space, an information space whose surface owed as much to
  modernist collage as it did to brute force calculation.” A human voice can be
  heard as the train races by spraying snow: “Oh my god.” </p>

  <p>04:40 The cursor brings the text file forward and begins typing: “We need to ask, what comes before (or after) discourse.” As the trains in all windows (except the Ducktails video) speed by, the human voice continues: “Oh my god. Holy crap. Oh my god. Ahhhhhhhhhh.”
  </p>

  <p>05:05 The cursor moves over the text file, and deletes the word, "ask." In
  all capital letters the cursor types FEEL, so the phrase now reads: “We need
  to Feel what comes before (or after) discourse.” </p>

  <p>05:20 The train in
  the lower-right finishes moving through the train crossing.  The sound of owls
  can be heard. The cursor scrolls down in the text file in the top right to
  reveal a list of articles that have been shown in the browser window. The
  cursor moves to the top of the screen and selects an icon, opening a drop down
  menu from which the cursor selects “Stop Recording.” The video stops.

<button class="accordion">Materials and Sources</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The bulk of materials provide train imagery and sounds. Videos like
  "CRAZY FAST eastbound CP & SOO train in Finch," "SUPER RARE! UP Freights Race
  through Fremont," "Vermont Train Chase: Green Mountain Train 263 - Fall 2013,"
  and "VERY VERY VERY FAST) CP stack/auto with two Olympic units!!" have been
  gathered from the countless "train sighting" postings on the YouTube web site. Two
  videos that depict owl imagery have also been sampled from the YouTube site.<p>

    <p>A key element of <em>Trainsplaining</em> is taken from the video,
    "Pitchfork Presents: Ducktails - The Flower Lane Release Party," which depicts
    a live performance by the band, Ducktails. The "Intro" segment of the video is
    sampled to create the musical backing track during the performance. This
    sampling weaves a small segment of the 117 minute video together with the
    other materials.</p>

  <p>  The video also includes scanned materials from scholarly books and
  articles. These are excerpted and displayed as a series of images that are woven
  together as quotations in the piece. Two quotations are also included in the
  form of video tickers. These have been created by screen recording the act of
  scrolling through a text document that includes the quotations. These videos
  also include owl sounds that are heard regularly as the quotations loop on the
  screen.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<P>This video was first performed at the 2014 Computers and Writing Conference
as part of a panel on new media and scholarly criticism. It brings together several video clips, scanned images from
scholarly articles and books, live typing, sound effects, and video "tickers"
containing quotations. The version here was recorded on June 10th,
2014 and includes footage of the author performing captured by the laptop
camera.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Affective tides ebb and flow. In their upswell
they prefigure emergent, far-from equilibrium follow-on movements whose
direction is increasingly unpredictable. Representation lies among the flotsam
and jetsam like a weather-beaten plastic bottle. <span class="attribution"> Erin
Manning and Brian Massumi, <strong>Thought in Act</strong> (16)</span></aside>


<p>This piece argues for the value of affect in scholarly communication. Many
scholars have written about the ways that affect can challenge traditional
academic modes, calling for (or modeling) registers that open rather than close
possibilities for meaning and linking affective scholarship to memory, personal
experience, and creative expression.  These possibilities can be amplified by
media materials. Visuals, sounds, and movement that evoke emotions are fixtures
of screen composing. Sean Morey tells us, "certainly print can evoke emotions,
feeling, and mood, but not in the same way as visual or tactile forms of
delivery" (107). Morey shows that emotional flows vary with modes of delivery,
and that affective approaches add complexity to compositions. Dance or war
imagery, for instance, provides channels for "sense-data that appears in many
digital modes, producing a mood, an emotion, but not always making this
conscious to the viewer" (53). </p>


<p>Images move us, and Morey connects agency with this moving, calling on W.J.T.
Mitchell to point out that "images have both lives and desires" (145). Images
linked with emotions and desire offer a posthuman placement of agency in media
materials that works well for understanding screen composing. Representation through affect
and emotions is easily possible in multimedia. The challenge is pausing to consider how
such a move relates to scholarship. If, as Jody Murray suggests, digital media
can become "the vehicle[s] from which belief becomes lived experience" and that
"images that are ambiguous, that defy translation into words, are precisely the
kind of images that are themselves the most generative, the most
non-discursive," then academic scholarship on (or through) the screen may resist
translation and present ambiguity as it takes up the rich imagistic
possibilities of media composing.</p>



<p>In their book, <em>Thought in Act</em>, Erin Manning and Brian Massumi
suggest that we can "compose with concepts already on their way in another mode,
in the mode of artistic practice, in the mode of event-formation, of activism,
of dance, even of everyday perception" (viii). They suggest that composing can
create "conceptual interference" that reveals unseen patterns. They write:
"Don't just write about the Dance. As William Forsythe says, dance that thought
around." Such performances reveal "composing across the breach between
philosophy and art, philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and
moving" (viii). With most composition, such transformation is to be had through
the right mixing of words. Trainsplaining asks, what concerns arise when we also
weave those words among the audiovisual layers of the screen.</p>



<p>At several points, a video containing a short quotation that scrolls from
right to left is brought on screen. This video snippet was made by typing the
quotation into a text editor, and then filming a segment of the screen as the
text is scrolled in the text editor window. It's an experimental technique that
responds to the challenges of moving scholarly citation into video modes. How
much text can be processed? How to mix words among images and sound? How to move
between written, spoken, and visual inscriptions of words? So many questions for
screen composers to consider.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">What mobilizes the rigor of a speculative pragmatism therefore cannot
be a method imposed on the process from without. The rigor must emerge
from within the occasion of experience, from the event’s own stakes in its
coming-to-be. <span class="attribution"> Erin Manning, <strong>The Minor Gesture</strong> (38)</span></aside>

<p>The video brings together more audiovisual elements in the form of video clips of
 trains. These clips create affective layers punctuated by the sounds
of approaching train horns. Morey tells us that media can deliver emotions,
feelings, and affect, and that these deliveries are ambient and embodied. "Feeling bridges a
primary emotion with a cognizant recognition of context. Feeling can change
based on situation or environment." (96). For Morey, emotional elements lead to
feelings, and affect is a kind of material for moving these feelings. "Affect
provides the current that allows emotions to exist. Affective flows can become
emotional which then can manifest into feelings" (99). "Holy Crap," a voice
exclaims at 04:45 in the video. The train speeding by is obscured by the snow
blowing in its wake. Over the sound of steel-on-steel coming from the wheels,
the voice continues, "Oh my God. Oooaaah. Ohhh."</p>

<p>Emotions, feelings, and affect lead to moods, and even the sublime in Morey's
ambient composing. Of course, the book presentation of Morey's model, with terms
like current and flows, returns us back to metaphor and calls for more language
if we are to close out the concepts. (Or, perhaps, more media if we are to open
them up.) The train horn in the performance plays with these feelings and flows,
adding an element of velocity and enacting Morey's observation that "this
emotional element (<em>pathos</em>) of rhetoric . . . provides an abandoned
thread that can benefit electrate delivery" (66). Or as Erin Manning puts it,
"knowing is incipient to the experience at hand, actively felt but often
indecipherable in linguistic terms" (37). The video is a speculative piece that
brings together emotional layers of media, casting messages through affective
materials that exceed discursive limits.
