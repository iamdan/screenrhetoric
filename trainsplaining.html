<p>This video contains several video clips that are arranged and played on screen while captured by a recorder. The clips contain music, imagery of trains, and imagery of owls. There are also video clips and still images containing quotations from scholarly articles. There are also segments where live typing in a text document takes place.
</p>
<p>00:00 The screen opens with media items arrayed in four quadrants of the screen: in the lower left, a YouTube clip shows a live performance by the band DuckTails. On the right side of the screen are clips of an owl and of a train waiting to cross a highway. In the upper lefts is a browser window with an excerpt of a scholarly article. The cursor clicks the play button on the clip and the band prepares to play. The cursor clicks play on several other video clips and imagery of owls and a train slowly crossing a highway appear. The sound of owls can be heard.
</p>
<p>00:43 The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights a phrase in the article: Digitality provides new haunts, new places for the spectral traces and strands of communication, figuration, and affect to circulate. The band beginning to perform eases into the song. A shaker can be heard beneath soft keyboards. Owl sounds can be heard. A steady ringing bell from a train can be heard softly.
</p>
<p>01:09 The cursor clicks the right side of the screen and a long, thing video jumps to the front of the clips. The thin video is partially transparent and contains text that scrolls from right to left that reads: Engelbarts demon included the first public use of a mouse, and the sight of its pointer sweeping across the screen instantly collapsed the stark input/output rhythms of batch-process and command-line computing into a single, continuous sweep of user activity. A train horn can be heard.
</p>
<p>01:35 The cursor moves to the top of the screen and brings forward a text file and begins to type: The train is on the tracks. But look how slowly it pulls from the station. The text file is partially transparent and in the video beneath the text file a train finishes crossing a highway and begins to pick up speed.
</p>
<p>02:04 The cursor moves to the left side of the screen and brings forward a video file and selects play.  An image of an approaching train appears. The cursor brings forward the browser window containing the excerpt from a scholarly article. The browser window is reloaded with a new excerpt from another article. The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights several terms in the text of the article: interace, map, contact zone, borders. The cursor highlights a segment of a file path in one of the videos, revealing the word desktop.
</p>
<p>02:48 The cursor moves to the top right and brings a new video clip forward, and selects play. An image of an approaching train appears. The sound of owls can be heard. In the upper-left, a new excerpt from an article is loaded into the browser window. The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights the phrase: That is why uncomfortable people can often change a system. They can see it.
</p>
<p>03:29 A voice over a radio can be heard calling out information about an upcoming train. A train horn can be heard in the distance. In the clip in the upper right, the image is zoomed in to show an approaching train. The cursor moves to the lower-right corner of the screen and brings a video clip forward that show a train crossing after heavy snow. A saxophone is added to the performance of the band Ducktails and the pace of the music picks up.
</p>
<p>03:44 In the upper-left, a new article excerpt is loaded into the browser window. The cursor turns into a spotlight and highlights the phrase: What performs a critique cannot also compose. The cursor moves to the upper left and brings a video forward above the browser window. In the video two trains on parallel tracks move quickly past a train platform. The sound of their wheels on the tracks can be heard. In the lower-right, the gate on the train crossing is lowered. The sound of clanging bells can be heard.
</p>
<p>04:10. The cursor grabs the browser window in the upper-left and moves to to the lower-right of the screen. A new excerpt has been loaded into the browser window. The sound of a train horn gets louder. A human voice can be heard mimicking the train horn. In the upper-right, the approaching train gets closer and closer. The sound of the train horn gets closer.
</p>
<p>04:22 The train horn gets closer and louder. The cursor clicks in the lower right and brings the clip with the train crossing in snow to the front. A freight train zooms past at high speed, spraying snow.  In the upper-right the approaching train also moves by at high speed. The cursor clicks in the upper-right and brings forward another long-thing video containing a ribbon of text. The text scrolls from right to left and reads:
</p>
<p>The cursur turns into a spotlight and highlights the phrase: The computer—or more specifically, the screen—had clearly become a much more complex representational space. An information space whose surface owed as much to modernist collage as it did to brute force calculation. A human voice can be heard as the train races by spraying snow: Oh my god.
</p>
<p>04:40 The cursor brings the text file forward and begins typing: We need to ask, what comes before (or after) discourse. As the trains speed by, the human voice continues: Oh my god. Ahhhhhhhhhh.
</p>
<p>05:05 The cursor moves over the text file, and deletes the work, "ask." In all capital letters the cursor types FEEL, so the phrase now reads: We need to Feel what comes before (or after) discourse.
</p>
<p>05:20 The train in the lower-left finishes moving through the train crossing.  The sound of owls can be heard. The cursor scrolls down in the text file to reveal a list of sources that have been shown in the browser window. The cursor move to the top of the screen and selects an icon, opening drop down menu from which the cursor selcts Stop Recording. The video ends.

<h2>About the Video</h2>



<p>This piece argues for the value of affect in scholarly communication. Many
scholars have written about the ways that emotions can challenge traditional
academic modes, arguing for (or modelling) bringing personal insights into
scholarship. This possibility can be amplified by media materials. Visuals,
sounds, and movement that evoke emotions are fixtures of screen rhetoric. Sean
Morey tells us, "certainly print can evoke emotions, feeling, and mood, but not
in the same way as visual or tactile forms of delivery" (107). Morey shows the
ways that modes can vary as means of delivery for emotions, and how these
approaches add complexity to compositions. Dance or war imagery, for instance,
provide channels for "sense-data that appears in many digital modes, producing a
mood, an emotion, but not always making this conscious to the viewer" (53) </p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">In the production of text, then, the "original"
discourse and design . . . are not pristine layers (or strata) that undergird
production layers. Instead, these layers are all changed; the text is changed.
It is no longer the original act of meaning-making: it is an entirerly new
one -- Non-Discursive Rhetoric 159</aside>


<p>Images move us, and Morey astutely points out the connections with agency
that come from this moving, calling on W.J.T Mitchel to point out that "images
have both lives and desires" (145). The posthuman impulses surfaces as
visuals take over our familiar habits of composing. Taking up affect and
emotions in multimedia makes sense. The challenge is pausing to consider how
such a move relates to print. If, as Jody Murray suggests, digtial media can
become "the vehicle[s] from which belief becomes lived experience" and that
"images that are ambiguous, that defy translation into words, are precisley the
kind of images that are themselves the most generative, the most
non-discursive," then channels like academic prose must have correlary strengths
or weaknesses. We should add to insights about the rich imagistic possibilities
of media reminders about the circuits and channels available through words.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Affective tides ebb and flow. In their upswell they prefigure
emergent, far-from equilibrium follow-on movements whose direction is increasingly unpredictable.
Representation lies among the flotsam and jetsam like a weather-beaten plastic bottle -- Thought in Act 16</aside>


<p>Erin Manning and Brian Massumi seek to enact some of the potential for play in
language in their book, <em>Thought in Act</em>, seeking "to compose with
concepts already on their way in another mode, in the mode of artistic practice,
in the mode of event-formation, of activism, of dance, even of everyday
perception . . . composing across the breach between
philosophy and art, philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and
moving" (viii). They suggest that composing (even with words ) can create "conceptual interference" that reveals unseen patterns. "Don't just write about the Dance. As William Forsythe says, dance that
thought around." Trainsplaining similarly works to make words dance, and amplifies the effect by layering the dancing as visual movement cast on the screen.</p>

alt="screenshot of Trainsplaining video"> <figcaption> <p>Scholarly Ticker with
quotation from Matthew Kirschenbaum</p>
</figcaption> </figure>

<p>At several points, a video containing a short quotation that scrolls from
right to left is brought on screen. This video snippet was made by typing the
quotataion into a text editor, and then filming a segment of the screen as the
text is scrolled in the text editor window. It's an experimental technique that
responds to the challenges of moving scholarly citation into video modes. How
much text can be processed? How to mix words among images and sound? How to move
between written, spoken, and visual inscriptions of words? So many questions for
screen composers to consider.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">What mobilizes the rigor of a speculative pragmatism therefore cannot
be a method imposed on the process from without. The rigor must emerge
from within the occasion of experience, from the event’s own stakes in its
coming- to-be. Technique is necessary. -- The Minor Gesture 38</aside>

<p>The video brings together affective elements in the form of video clips of
approaching trains. These clips create affective layers punctuated by the sounds
of approaching train horns. Morey helpfully unpacks the ways that media can
deliver emotions, feelings, and affect. "Feeling bridges a primary emotion with
a cognizant recognition of context. Feeling can change based on situation or
environment." (96). Emotional elements lead to feelings. Morey sees affect as a
kind of material for moving these feelings. "Affect provides the current that
allows emotions to exist. Affective flows can become emotional which then can
manifest into feelings" (99).</p>

<p>Emotions, feelings, and affect lead to moods, and even the sublime in Morey's
discussion. Of course, now we're writing about them with terms like current and
flows, retunring us back to metaphor and more feelings. The train horn in the
plays with these feelings and flows, adding an element of velocity and enacting
Morey's observation that "this emotional element (<em>pathos</em>) of rhetoric . . .
provides an abandoned thread that can benefit electrate delivery" (66). Or as
Erin Manning puts it, "knowing is incipient to the experience at hand, actively
felt but often indecipherable in linguistic terms, alive only in its rhythms, in
its hesitations, in its stuttering" (37).
