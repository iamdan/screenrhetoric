<h2>About the Video</h2>



<p>This piece argues for the value of affect in scholarly communication. Many
scholars have written about the ways that emotions can challenge traditional
academic modes, arguing for (or modelling) bringing personal insights into
scholarship. This possibility can be amplified by media materials. Visuals,
sounds, and movement that evoke emotions are fixtures of screen rhetoric. Sean
Morey tells us, "certainly print can evoke emotions, feeling, and mood, but not
in the same way as visual or tactile forms of delivery" (107). Morey shows the
ways that modes can vary as means of delivery for emotions, and how these
approaches add complexity to compositions. Dance or war imagery, for instance,
provide channels for "sense-data that appears in many digital modes, producing a
mood, an emotion, but not always making this conscious to the viewer" (53) </p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">In the production of text, then, the "original"
discourse and design . . . are not pristine layers (or strata) that undergird
production layers. Instead, these layers are all changed; the text is changed.
It is no longer the original act of meaning-making: it is an entirerly new
one -- Non-Discursive Rhetoric 159</aside>


<p>Images move us, and Morey astutely points out the connections with agency
that come from this moving, calling on W.J.T Mitchel to point out that "images
have both lives and desires" (145). The posthuman impulses surfaces as
visuals take over our familiar habits of composing. Taking up affect and
emotions in multimedia makes sense. The challenge is pausing to consider how
such a move relates to print. If, as Jody Murray suggests, digtial media can
become "the vehicle[s] from which belief becomes lived experience" and that
"images that are ambiguous, that defy translation into words, are precisley the
kind of images that are themselves the most generative, the most
non-discursive," then channels like academic prose must have correlary strengths
or weaknesses. We should add to insights about the rich imagistic possibilities
of media reminders about the circuits and channels available through words.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Affective tides ebb and flow. In their upswell they prefigure
emergent, far-from equilibrium follow-on movements whose direction is increasingly unpredictable.
Representation lies among the flotsam and jetsam like a weather-beaten plastic bottle -- Thought in Act 16</aside>


<p>Erin Manning and Brian Massumi seek to enact some of the potential for play in
language in their book, <em>Thought in Act</em>, seeking "to compose with
concepts already on their way in another mode, in the mode of artistic practice,
in the mode of event-formation, of activism, of dance, even of everyday
perception . . . composing across the breach between
philosophy and art, philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and
moving" (viii). They suggest that composing (even with words ) can create "conceptual interference" that reveals unseen patterns. "Don't just write about the Dance. As William Forsythe says, dance that
thought around." Trainsplaining similarly works to make words dance, and amplifies the effect by layering the dancing as visual movement cast on the screen.</p>

quotation from Matthew Kirschenbaum</p>
</figcaption> </figure>

<p>At several points, a video containing a short quotation that scrolls from
right to left is brought on screen. This video snippet was made by typing the
quotataion into a text editor, and then filming a segment of the screen as the
text is scrolled in the text editor window. It's an experimental technique that
responds to the challenges of moving scholarly citation into video modes. How
much text can be processed? How to mix words among images and sound? How to move
between written, spoken, and visual inscriptions of words? So many questions for
screen composers to consider.

<aside class="pullquote-left">What mobilizes the rigor of a speculative pragmatism therefore cannot
be a method imposed on the process from without. The rigor must emerge
from within the occasion of experience, from the eventâ€™s own stakes in its
coming- to-be. Technique is necessary. -- The Minor Gesture 38</aside>

The video brings together affective elements in the form of video clips of
approaching trains. These clips create affective layers punctuated by the sounds
of approaching train horns. Morey helpfully unpacks the ways that media can
deliver emotions, feelings, and affect. "Feeling bridges a primary emotion with
a cognizant recognition of context. Feeling can change based on situation or
environment." (96). Emotional elements lead to feelings. Morey sees affect as a
kind of material for moving these feelings. "Affect provides the current that
allows emotions to exist. Affective flows can become emotional which then can
manifest into feelings" (99).</p>

<p>Emotions, feelings, and affect lead to moods, and even the sublime in Morey's
discussion. Of course, now we're writing about them with terms like current and
flows, retunring us back to metaphor and more feelings. The train horn in the
plays with these feelings and flows, adding an element of velocity and enacting
Morey's observation that "this emotional element (<em>pathos</em>) of rhetoric . . .
provides an abandoned thread that can benefit electrate delivery" (66). Or as
Erin Manning puts it, "knowing is incipient to the experience at hand, actively
felt but often indecipherable in linguistic terms, alive only in its rhythms, in
its hesitations, in its stuttering" (37).
