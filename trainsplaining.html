<h2>About the Video</h2>



<p>This piece argues for the value of affect in communication. Linking affect to
media is a core aspect of screen rhetoric. Visuals, sounds, and mixed materials
evoking emotions are fixtures of screen rhetoric. Sean Morey tells us,
"certainly print can evoke emotions, feeling, and mood, but not in the same way
as visual or tactile forms of delivery" (107). Morey shows the ways that modes
can vary as means of delivery for emotions. Dance or war imagery, for instance,
provide channels for "sense-data that appears in many digital modes, producing a
mood, an emotion, but not always making this conscious to the viewer" (53) </p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">In the production of text, then, the "original"
discourse and design . . . are not pristine layers (or strata) that undergird
production layers. Instead, these layers are all changed; the text is changed.
It is no longer the origianl act of meaning-making: it is an entirerly new
one -- Non-Discursive Rhetoric 159</aside>


<p>Taking up affect and emotions in multimedia makes sense. The challenge is
pausing to consider how such a move relates to print. If, as Jody Murray
suggests, digtial media can become "the vehicle[s] from which belief becomes
lived experience" and that "images that are ambiguous, that defy translation
into words, are precisley the kind of images that are themselves the most
generative, the most non-discursive," then channels like academic prose must
have correlary strengths or weaknesses. We should add to insights about the rich
imagistic possibilities of media reminders about the circuits and channels
available through words.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">To deliver in this way is to perform the
electronic monument, through which the deliverer becomes attuned to the
information sphere until she notices a sting, theorized as Roland Barthes’s
punctum, a sensation under the skin. . . . The deliverer is not looking to solve
the problem, but to understand her relationship to the problem and how that
problem manifests itself inside of her – Rhetorical Delivery and Digital
Technologies 254 </aside>

<p>Images move us, and Morey astutely points out the connections with agency
that come from this moving, calling on W.J.T Mitchel to point out that "images
have both lives and desires" (145). The posthuman impulses surfaces again as
visuals take over our familiar habits of composing. If we allow them to. The
transactional nature of these emotional exchanges of meaning</p>
