    <em>Sediment</em>
    was presented at the 2012 Computers and Writing Conference. It is a
    recorded performance that brings together multiple videos. A video showing
    lathing creates a steady scraping sound. Videos with compilations of
    imagery and sound appear in various places on the screen. There are also
    two videos from earlier projects. <em>Waves</em> (included in this
collection) takes up scholarly responses in print and video.    <em>Now I Have Everything I Need</em> was developed collaboratively through
    a video exchange with Jason Loan.
</p>
<p>
    The two previously developed videos foreground questions of textual
    relationships. The meaning of the video <em>Sediment</em> accrues in part
    as these intertextual materials flow into the new composition as layers and
    through windows. The audio in the piece includes sounds from composite
    videos that at times compete with one another and challenge
    decipherability. The piece also includes a narrative track, which is
    straightforward and features memoir and scholarly discussion.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

 <p>
    00:00 The video opens with a title screen: "Sediment / Daniel Anderson."
    The title fades out and is replaced by white text on a black screen: "The
    prosumer marks the blurring of consumption and production. But might the
    prosumer also represent a new mode of composing? Lev Manovich notes that
    spatialized narrative in the twentieth century 'was relegated to "minor"
    cultural forms such as comics or technical illustrations. "Real" culture of
    the twentieth century came to speak of linear chains, aligning itself with
    the assembly line of the industrial society. . . .'" (232).
</p>
<p>
    00:19 New text appears on screen: "What if we imagine modes that make
    meaning with simultaneous arrangements and loops?" The text fades out,
    revealing a laptop screen with multiple video windows. In the lower left,
    video footage of a round stock of white plastic begins turning on a lathe.
    The sound of the lathe motor turning and the bit scraping the plastic can
    be heard.
</p>
<p>
    00:32 The cursor brings forward additional videos and selects play. In the
    upper left, the video <em>Waves</em> begins to play, featuring a live music
    performance of the song "Postcard from 1952" by Explosions in the Sky. A
    video begins to play in the lower right showing a man in a river bed
    balancing small rocks on top of one another. A video showing design
    sketches for a sediment trap appears in the upper right.
</p>
<p>
    00:42 The narrator begins speaking: "Point one, the prosumer is personal.
    I'm drifting back to 1974, to my Dad's sabbatical, when we put sediment
    traps in lakes up and down the West Coast. My Dad invented a sediment trap
    with a device for marking time. The intervalometer would periodically drop
    a layer of Teflon powder in the collection tube. We would place the traps
    in lakes, then return years later to retrieve them to study the sediment."
</p>
<p>
    01:15 Music begins to play softly in the background. The narrator
    continues: "The prosumer is about boundaries, or
    really about how boundaries can be metaphors for emergence. As Heidegger
    reminds us, 'a boundary is not [that at which] something stops . . . a
    boundary is that from which something begins its essential unfolding.'"
</p>
<p>
    01:38 In the upper right, a video shows images of an outboard boat engine
    being repaired, mixed with images of origami paper being folded. The
    narrator continues: "Point two: The prosumer shapes materials. Three years
    later, one high-school summer, I built the intervalometers, working the
    lathe, engaging the motor, easing the bits into plastic. I remember the
    steady circling, the making-by-taking-away."
</p>
<p>
    02:02 The cursor brings various video windows to the front of the screen.
    The moving images contain multiple, partially transparent layers showing
    lathing, outboard boat engines, sediment traps, origami, and rock
    balancing. The narrator continues: "I bought my first antique bike with the
    lathe money, a '50s cruiser. It probably weighed sixty pounds. It folded in
    half on a hill a few years later. I should have known better. I was taught
    to love machines, to care for them, to find an engine leak by the smell—the
    antifreeze sweet or the almost toasty edge of burning oil. I was taught to
    feel them . . . to listen."
</p>
<p>
    02:44 An animated bird hops within the frame of the <em>Waves</em> video
    window. In the lower right of the screen, the handwritten phrase "this is
    writing" is barely distinguishable as a layer over the video of the man
    balancing rocks. Indistinct voices can be heard softly amid the sound of
    the music; a snippet of speech is audible: "I don't think I've ever had
    closure with Pine Point." The narrator continues: "That bike crank was
    wrong for a long time. It needed lubricating, rebuilding. It needed
    attention."
</p>
<p>
    03:02 In the background, the music becomes clearer. The narrator continues:
    "The prosumer is concrete. It cracks like metal under stress. It shapes
    something out of nothing and makes interventions through time, collecting
    what is offered by the winds and the tides. I'm talking about a making,
    wrought through layers, from binary-switching to coded collections of
    objects to moving images like these, making statements that sound much like
    heart valve closing and opening or painting on cave wall or words scratched
    on tablet with graphite wrapped in wood dipped in finish and pressed with
    its value—2B."
</p>
<p>
    03:55 A small two-stroke engine can be heard softly in the background. The
    videos of lathing and boat motor repair continue to play. The video window
    in the lower right showing the man balancing rocks is nearly covered with
    scrawled writing. The narrator continues: "We pencil in our timelines,
    tracing, tracking, making the report, the resume, profile essay; sort out
    the sequences and try to bind them together: 'I'm a bio major. I'm
    business. I'm poli sci.' Together, we take up the instrument, squeeze its
    laminated length between fingers and pour language until . . ."
</p>
<p>
    04:30 In the background, the music continues to pick up in intensity. Crowd
    sounds can be heard. In the lower left, a video depicting underwater diving
    appears, its greenish light offering contrast to the reds and grays of the
    other windows. The narrator continues: "The prosumer becomes a metaphor for
    all meaning making where, as Andrew Pickering reminds us, 'the center of
    gravity . . . lies . . . at the . . . intersection of human and material
    agency.'"
</p>
<p>
    04:47 In the upper left, the cursor brings forward a video titled
    "Principles of Stratigraphy and Cross-Cutting Relationships." The narrator
    continues: "Point three: the prosumer works in every mode. The way ideas
    flow in rivulets up a windshield in the rain, droplets lifted back toward
    source by motion forward. The labor of the prosumer is craft and the logic
    sparks across darkened splits. Hydraulic tensioners on a timing chain
    dampen sound; pure metal sings a higher pitch."
</p>
<p>
    05:20 On screen in the video in the upper right, hundreds of metal balls
    bounce as they are shaken in an experiment. Turning chains and gears are
    visible in the video in the lower left of the screen. The narrator
    continues: "What happens when the screen becomes the space for composing?
    Then word becomes one among many modes, then computing becomes performing.
    The zoom tool translates layers, the smallest granules become the scale
    through which we witness the world. Then, zoomed out, the sediment is the
    memory of the earth. It's best not to be measured by what we're called, but
    by what we do."
</p>
<p>
    05:57 In the background, the intensity of the music continues to pick up.
    In the upper right, the frequency of the metal balls bouncing increases.
    The sound of breathing through a SCUBA respirator can be heard. The
    narrator continues: "Keith Sawyer says our making must be not too rigid,
    but not too loose: 'the critical balance for innovation is at the edge of
    chaos.'"
</p>
<p>
    06:10 In the upper right, the metal balls bounce in many different
    directions. In the lower right, words, both typed and handwritten, continue
    to scrawl across the video showing rock stacking. The narrator continues:
    "Point four: the prosumer pulls like memory. The theory is the smell of
    bread, maybe ginger-tinged or yeasty at least, warm from the oven, because
    making is also reaching backwards. We're all intervalometers within streams
    of sediment gathered from sounds like stones or words like iron gone ferric
    in rusted bearings. Prosumer time is not just left to right, but up and
    down. It's a blending that ceases to be sequence and becomes instead space,
    playing out like sand plying and flowing, alluvial, slow combing, for a
    moment—forgotten."
</p>
<p>
    07:09 In the upper right, the metal balls bounce frantically. The sound of
    breathing through the SCUBA respirator can be heard. The music in the
    background continues to pick up in intensity. In the upper left of the
    screen, two small windows show an old man making large soap bubbles on a
    beach and the reflection of the sun on jet contrails along with other
    elements of the <em>Waves</em> video. The narrator continues: "Final
    point/first point: the prosumer has nothing to prove. As Nietzsche tells
    us, 'we believe that we know something about things themselves when we
    speak of trees, colors, snow; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for
    things' (82–83). When we recognize the makings of thought in the material
    world, linear time begins to loop into thing and event, noun and verb."
</p>
<p>
    07:41 In the lower right, the volume is turned up on the video of the
    figure balancing rocks. The figure works intently to balance a small rock
    on top of two others. Other windows continue to shift between the
    foreground and background. The narrator continues: "The prosumer no longer
    asks us to stake a claim. When the blossoms are coming, we feel their
    forward turning—the dogwood bud a capsuled blast of papered thought waiting
    to unfold. We compose because we, too, are turning: the soil, the eye
    toward flower, making arrays in the face of the abyss."
</p>
<p>
    08:11. In the upper right, an old photograph of a figure on a 1950s bicycle
    appears. A smiling woman sits at a desk in the frame in the upper left. The
    narrator continues: "Let the value of field one be performing. Let field
    two be time. Let the value of our field be becoming."
</p>
<p>
    08:38 The music in the background fades out. The sound of the lathe bit
    scraping plastic can be heard along with the sound of a crowd cheering. In
    the lower right, the figure successfully balances the small rock on top of
    the others. The voice of a spectator can be heard: "So cool. Wow that was
    so beautiful. Oh, that's amazing. Beautiful. So exciting. Thank you for
    letting me record it. Um. I. It really feels so tribal. Like so, so
    elemental. So human." Soft, jazz piano is barely audible. The cursor
    selects stop on the clips still playing on screen. The video ends.

    <em>Sediment</em>
    includes video compilations that have been developed specifically for the
    performance. One composite includes imagery of origami folding combined
    with imagery of an outboard motor being rebuilt. Additional imagery shows
    information on sediment formation. A second compilation brings together
    samples from videos showing lathing. A number of materials from a patent
    application for a sediment intervalometer are also included as well as a
    personal photograph of the author.
</p>
<p>
    There are also materials sampled from YouTube, including videos on engine
    repair, sediment formation, underwater SCUBA diving, and a video showing
    granule processes. The piece also repurposes two videos from prior
    projects. <em>Waves</em> includes imagery from an abandoned town and
    multiple blog postings to highlight print behaviors.
   
        <em>Now I Have Everything I Need</em> displays writing over imagery of rock balancing to suggest that composing
    is layered.

<h4>Discussion</h4>



<aside class="pullquote-left">Once one has trained one's eyes to recognize in a scholarly treatise the
    scholar's intellectual idiosyncrasy—every scholar has one—and to catch it
    in the act, one will almost always behold behind the scholar's
    "prehistory," his family, and especially their occupations and crafts. <span class="attribution">Friedrich Nietzsche, <span class="attribution-title">The Gay Science</span>

<p>
    The video suggests that the memory inside computers blends with our own.
    There is a permeable boundary between the physical inscription of the
    machine and the recollections of the past conjured by the scanned
    photograph of a long ago boating trip, the clip of the rebuilt engine
    coughing to life, the images, sounds, and words that move through our
    screens. This video creates temporal, meaningful loops by repurposing
    earlier projects and mixing them with nostalgic sounds and images. The
    stories are true and linked with items from the author's past: the outboard
    motor, the bicycle, the bit of the lathe—the stuff of memory.
</p>
<p>
    These accumulated materials are brought into the video as granules in
    layers (settling and solidifying) and loops playing out in time. The music,
    for instance, is borrowed from the <em>Waves</em> video recorded some
    months earlier. The repurposed materials enact the "writerly" text
    associated with Roland Barthes, who suggests that meaning develops both
    sequentially within the text, where it "proliferates by layering," and
through correlation with "other meanings outside the material text" (8). In    <em>Sediment</em>, these intertextual correlations actualize as video
    artifacts settling into the performance. No doubt, this complicates the
    reading, which, for Barthes, is a good thing, since it "make[s] the reader
    no longer a consumer, but a producer of the text" (4). Screen composing
    evokes productive experiences for readers as meaning multiplies and resists
    closure. This fits well with Barthes's model, since "forgetting meanings is
    not a matter for excuses, an unfortunate defect in the performance; it is
    an affirmative value" (11).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Sediment</em>
    was created with a one-take performance, captured to create the visual
    layer. This take also includes the background sounds. After this capturing,
    the audio narration has been added. In the video, the entities emerge in
    flows and loops like the steady spinning of the plastic stock on the lathe.
    This emergence plays out as the performer adjusts the many windows on
    screen. These performances mark what Erin Manning (following Henri Bergson)
    casts from duration as "eventfulness," the experience of prehension where
    time passes past into future. The pieces of <em>Sediment</em> are "composed
    of strands of pastness recomposing and perishing through [the present]"
    (67). And though the materials are gathered from the past, the recomposing
    is about the copresent experience of bringing together the pieces through
    meaningful moments "where what we see is a composition of holes (intervals)
    and wholes (pure experience, duration) that together create a field of
    forces around which perception takes form" (85).

    talking about an extreme re-visioning, a fundamental rupturing/shedding
    that breaks with the humanistic program altogether. We're talking about the
    anticipation of and projection into a future not tethered by the bonds of
    reaction, an active decision to let memory go. <span class="attribution">Diane Davis, <span class="attribution-title">Breaking up [at] Totality</span>

<p>
    Manning links this form-taking to feeling via the interval, where/when
    "affect passes directly through the body, coupling with the nervous system
" (95). For Manning, images (like those of Étienne-Jules Marey) reveal a "force of
    composition" through which "affective duration is felt" (95). For screen
    composers, this linking of feeling and intervals opens pathways for
    creating in registers that embody eventfulness. Manning points out
    the overflow of compositional resources in these modes that are "brimming
    over with microperceptions, with microexpressions never quite actualized"
    (95). Ultimately, "what is produced is sensation or feeling, affective
    tone" (95).
</p>
<p>
    The sound of the lathe bit biting into the plastic stock creates looping
    that sustains the sonic and visual experience of the video. The meaning of
    the lathing is hard to pin down. The steady cutting sound evokes sensation.
    The spinning plastic stock offers duration and event. Here, to borrow from
    Manning, "the composition is not a translation: it is a transduction of
    movement into sensation through the prism of the image" (95). This
    transduction creates a new mode of seeing fit for the layered and moving
    windows where "what we perceive is the feeling of intensity. We feel
    intensity without seeing its actual form" (96). Intensity can't easily be
    measured but can be felt and critically deployed through video scholarship
    and screen composing.
</p>
<p>
    The bit of the lathe makes by taking away layer after layer of plastic. A
    shape emerges, a canister, a lid; add a groove for an O-ring and you have a
    watertight container that can hold a timer. The sediment traps referred to
    in the video drop a layer of Teflon powder in a collection tube every
    thirty days using a timer sealed in a watertight container made by hand on
    a machine lathe in 1977. The layers mark moments that themselves
    became/become temporal loops folded slowly with the daily drifting of
    granules into the collection tube. The sealed device was patented for
marking geologic time in the sediment of lakes: the intervalometer.
