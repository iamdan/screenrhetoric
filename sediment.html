<p>Sediment</p>

<p>This video brings together a number of videos. Some itmes are stand-alone clips gathered from the internet. Other clips are composites that have been arranged to highlight motifs like engine repair or lathing. Other clips are captured performances that have been repurposed from other projects. One repurpsed clip (Waves) contains an audio track with music that plays throught this video. It also includes vocal narration.
</p>
<p>00:00 The video opens with text on the screen: The prosumer marks the blurring of consumption and production. But might the prosumer also represent a new mode of composing? Lev Manovich notes that spatialized narrative in the twentieth century "was relegated to minor cultural forms such as comics of technical illustrations. 'Real' culture of the twentieth centru came to speak of linear chaings, aligning itself with the assembly line of the industrial society. . . ." (232)
</p>
<p>00:19 New text appears on screen: What if we imagine modes that make meaning with simultaneous arrangements and loops? Text fades out revealing a laptop screen with multiple video windows. The cursor moves to a video in the lower-left and selects play. A round stock of white plastic begins turning on a lathe. The sound of the lathe bit scraping the plastic can be heard.
</p>
<p>00:32 The cursor brings forward additonal videos and selects play. The video, "Waves," begins to play. A video showing a male figure balancing small rocks on top of one another begins to play in the lower right. A video showing design sketches for a sediment trap appears in the upper right.
</p>
<p>00:42 A narrator begins spe aking: Point one, the prosumer is personal. I'm drifting to 1974, to my dad's sabbatical when we put sediment traps in lakes up and down the west coast. My dad invented a sediment trap with a device for marking time. The intervalometer would periodically drop a layer of Teflon powder in the collection tube. We would place the traps in lakes, then return years later to retrieve them to study the sediment.
</p>
<p>01:15 Music begins to play softly in the background. The narrator continues: The prosumer is about boundaries or really about how boundaries can be metaphors for emergence. As Heidegger reminds us, “a boundary is not [where] something stops . . . a boundary is that from which something begins its essential unfolding” (356).
</p>
<p>01:38 In the video in the upper right images of an outboard boat engine being repaired appear, mixed with images of origami paper being folded. The narrator continues: Point two: The prosumer shapes materials. Three years later, one high-school summer, I built the intervalometers, working the lathe, engaging the motor, easing the bits into plastic. I remember the steady circling, the making  by taking away.
</p>
<p>02:02 The cursor brings various video windows to the front of the screen. The images contain multiple partially transparent layers with lathing, outboard boat engines, sediment traps, origami, and rock balancing. The narrator continues: I bought my first antique bike with the lathe money, a ‘50s cruiser. It probably weighed sixty pounds. It folded in half on a hill a few years later. I should have known better. I was taught to love machines, to care for them, to find an engine leak by the smell—antifreeze sweet or the almost toasty edge of burning oil. I was taught to feel them, to listen.
</p>
<p>02:44 Indistinct voices can be heard softly amidst the sound of the music. A snippet of speech can be heard: "I don't think I've ever had closure with Pinepoint." The narrator continues: That bike crank was wrong for a long time. It needed lubricating, rebuilding. It needed attention.
</p>
<p>03:02 In the background the intensity of the music picks up. The narrator continues: The prosumer is concrete. It cracks like metal under stress, it shapes something out of nothing and makes interventions through time, collecting what is offered by the winds and the tides.
I'm talking about a making wrought through layers, from binary switching to coded collections of objects to moving images like these, making statements that sound much like heart valve closing and opening or painting on cave wall or words scratched on tablet with graphite wrapped in wood dipped in finish and pressed with its value--2B.
</p>
<p>03:55 A small 2-stroke engine can be heard softly in the background. The narrator continues: We pencil in our timelines, tracing, tracking, making the report, the resume, profile essay; sort out the sequences and try to bind them together: I'm a bio major. I'm business. I'm poli-sci. Together, we take up the instrument, squeeze its laminated length between fingers and pour language until. . . .
</p>
<p>04:30 In the background the music continues to pick up in intensity. Crowd sounds can be heard. In the lower-left a video depicting underwater diving appears. The narrator continues: The prosumer becomes a metaphor for all meaning making where, as Andrew Pickering reminds us, “the center of gravity . . . lies . . . at the . . . intersection of human and material agency” (168).
</p>
<p>04:47 In the upper left, the cursor brings forward a video titled, "Principles of Stratigraphy." The narrator continues: Point three: the prosumer works in every mode. The way ideas flow in rivulets up a windshield in the rain, droplets lifted back toward source by motion forward. The labor of the prosumer is craft and the logic sparks across darkened splits. Hydraulic tensioners on a timing chain dampen sound; pure metal sings a higher pitch.
</p>
<p>05:20 In the video in the upper right, a large collection of metal balls bounce as it is shaken in an experiment. The narrator continues: What happens when the screen becomes the space for composing? Then word becomes one among many modes, then computing becomes becomes performing. The zoom tool translates layers, the smallest granules become the scale through which we witness the world. Then, zoomed out, the sediment is the memory of the earth. It's best not to be measured by what we’re called, but by what we do.
</p>
<p>05:57 In the background the intensity of the music continues to pick up. The sound of breathing through a SCUBA respirator can be heard. The narrator continues: Keith Sawyer says our making must be not too rigid, but not too loose: "the critical balance for innovation is 'at the edge of chaos.'”
</p>
<p>06:10 In the upper right, the metal balls bounce with more intensity. The narrator continues: Point four: the prosumer pulls like memory. The theory is the smell of bread, maybe ginger tinged or yeasty at least, warm from the oven because making is also reaching backwards. We're all intervalometers within streams of sediment gathered from sounds like stones or words like iron gone ferric in rusted bearings. Prosumer time is not just left to right but up and down. It’s a blending that ceases to be sequence and becomes instead space, playing out like sand plying and flowing, alluvial, slow combing, for a moment forgotten.
</p>
<p>07:09. In the upper right, the ball bearings bounce frantically. The sound of breathing through the SCUBA respirator can be heard. The music in the backgound continues to pick up in intensity. The narrator continues: Final point/first point: the prosumer has nothing to prove. As Nietzsche, tells us, "we believe that we know something about things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things" (82-83). When we recognize the makings of thought in the material world, linear time begins to loop into thing and event, noun and verb.
</p>
<p>07:41 In the lower right, the volume is turned up on the video of the figure balancing rocks. The figure works intently to balance a small rock on top of two others. The narrator continues: The prosumer no longer asks us to stake a claim. When the blossoms are coming, we feel their forward turning, the dogwood bud a capsuled blast of papered thought waiting to unfold. We compose because we, too, are turning, the soil, the eye toward flower, making arrays in the face of the abyss.
</p>
<p>08:11. In the upper right an old photograph of a figure on a 1950s bicycle appears. The narrator continues: Let the value of field one be performing. Let field two be time. Let the value of our field be becoming.
</p>
<p>08:38 The music in the background fades out. The sound of the lathe bit scraping plastic can be heard. In the lower right,the figure successfully balances the small rock on top of the others. The voice of a spectator can be heard: So cool. Wow that was so beautiful. Oh, that's amazing. Beautiful. So exciting. Thank you for letting me record it. It really feels so tribal. Like so elemental. So human. The cursor selects stop on the clips still playing on screen. The video ends.

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-left">Music becomes its own affective ground, our of
which emerge future musical directions. To put this differently, various
feedback loops arise--sonic, affective, haptic, performative--and transform the
music at every moment as it emerges within, permeates, and colors the local
environment -- Ambient Rhetoric 29</aside>

<p>It's clear that the memory inside computers is partially our own. Its a permeable
boundary between the physical inscription of the memory in the machine and the
recollections of the past conjured by the scanned
photograph of a long ago boating trip, the coughing to life of the rebuilt engine,
the mentor's gentle challenge, the images, sounds, and words that move through
our screens. This video captures the past in the form of repurposed videos and
nostalgic images. The stories are true. Sediment traps a record by working with
granules: the outboard motor, the bicycle, and the bee sting--the stuff of
memory. </p>

<p>These accumulations are at once layers, settling and solidifying, and loops
playing out in time. The music in this video, for instance, is captured in the
"Waves" video from the past and recast here. The recasting--of course--is the
mobius movement from object to event, space and time. "Place is less a stable
notion than an affective, circulating, and evolving series of encounters," (44)
Rickert tells us. The story of Pinepoint Canada is layered into the "Waves"
video, which is layered into Sediment. We can pause over these objects, "but
everything interesting happens upstream and downstream" (237), Bruno Latour
tells us. "Go with the flow," he says, "follow the circulating entities" (237).

<p>Sediment was created with a one-take performance, captured to create the visual
layer. This take also includes the background sounds. Over this layer, the audio
narration has been added.

  In Sediment, the entities are outboard motors and rocks and sounds. The
entities emerge in flows and loops like the  steady spinning of the plastic
stock on the lathe. </p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Objects are no longer merely unverifiable
hypotheses that perhaps lie  somewhere out there beyond our perception and
perhaps do not. Instead, though hiding from all comers, they extend their forces
into the world like the petals of a rose or the tentacles of an octopus. --
