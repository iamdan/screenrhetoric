<p>Sediment</p>

<p>This video brings together a number of videos. Some items are stand-alone clips gathered from the internet. Other clips are composites that have been arranged to highlight motifs like engine repair or lathing. Other clips are captured performances that have been repurposed from other projects. One repurposed clip (Waves) contains an audio track with music that plays through this video. It also includes vocal narration.
</p>
<p>00:00 The video opens with text on the screen: The prosumer marks the blurring of consumption and production. But might the prosumer also represent a new mode of composing? Lev Manovich notes that spatialized narrative in the twentieth century "was relegated to minor cultural forms such as comics of technical illustrations. 'Real' culture of the twentieth century came to speak of linear chains, aligning itself with the assembly line of the industrial society. . . ." (232)
</p>
<p>00:19 New text appears on screen: What if we imagine modes that make meaning with simultaneous arrangements and loops? Text fades out revealing a laptop screen with multiple video windows. The cursor moves to a video in the lower-left and selects play. A round stock of white plastic begins turning on a lathe. The sound of the lathe bit scraping the plastic can be heard.
</p>
<p>00:32 The cursor brings forward additional videos and selects play. The video, "Waves," begins to play. A video showing a male figure balancing small rocks on top of one another begins to play in the lower right. A video showing design sketches for a sediment trap appears in the upper right.
</p>
<p>00:42 A narrator begins speaking: Point one, the prosumer is personal. I'm drifting to 1974, to my dad's sabbatical when we put sediment traps in lakes up and down the west coast. My dad invented a sediment trap with a device for marking time. The intervalometer would periodically drop a layer of Teflon powder in the collection tube. We would place the traps in lakes, then return years later to retrieve them to study the sediment.
</p>
<p>01:15 Music begins to play softly in the background. The narrator continues: The prosumer is about boundaries or really about how boundaries can be metaphors for emergence. As Heidegger reminds us, “a boundary is not [where] something stops . . . a boundary is that from which something begins its essential unfolding” (356).
</p>
<p>01:38 In the video in the upper right images of an outboard boat engine being repaired appear, mixed with images of origami paper being folded. The narrator continues: Point two: The prosumer shapes materials. Three years later, one high-school summer, I built the intervalometers, working the lathe, engaging the motor, easing the bits into plastic. I remember the steady circling, the making  by taking away.
</p>
<p>02:02 The cursor brings various video windows to the front of the screen. The images contain multiple partially transparent layers with lathing, outboard boat engines, sediment traps, origami, and rock balancing. The narrator continues: I bought my first antique bike with the lathe money, a ‘50s cruiser. It probably weighed sixty pounds. It folded in half on a hill a few years later. I should have known better. I was taught to love machines, to care for them, to find an engine leak by the smell—antifreeze sweet or the almost toasty edge of burning oil. I was taught to feel them, to listen.
</p>
<p>02:44 Indistinct voices can be heard softly amidst the sound of the music. A snippet of speech can be heard: "I don't think I've ever had closure with Pinepoint." The narrator continues: That bike crank was wrong for a long time. It needed lubricating, rebuilding. It needed attention.
</p>
<p>03:02 In the background the intensity of the music picks up. The narrator continues: The prosumer is concrete. It cracks like metal under stress, it shapes something out of nothing and makes interventions through time, collecting what is offered by the winds and the tides.
I'm talking about a making wrought through layers, from binary switching to coded collections of objects to moving images like these, making statements that sound much like heart valve closing and opening or painting on cave wall or words scratched on tablet with graphite wrapped in wood dipped in finish and pressed with its value--2B.
</p>
<p>03:55 A small 2-stroke engine can be heard softly in the background. The narrator continues: We pencil in our timelines, tracing, tracking, making the report, the resume, profile essay; sort out the sequences and try to bind them together: I'm a bio major. I'm business. I'm poli-sci. Together, we take up the instrument, squeeze its laminated length between fingers and pour language until. . . .
</p>
<p>04:30 In the background the music continues to pick up in intensity. Crowd sounds can be heard. In the lower-left a video depicting underwater diving appears. The narrator continues: The prosumer becomes a metaphor for all meaning making where, as Andrew Pickering reminds us, “the center of gravity . . . lies . . . at the . . . intersection of human and material agency” (168).
</p>
<p>04:47 In the upper left, the cursor brings forward a video titled, "Principles of Stratigraphy." The narrator continues: Point three: the prosumer works in every mode. The way ideas flow in rivulets up a windshield in the rain, droplets lifted back toward source by motion forward. The labor of the prosumer is craft and the logic sparks across darkened splits. Hydraulic tensioners on a timing chain dampen sound; pure metal sings a higher pitch.
</p>
<p>05:20 In the video in the upper right, a large collection of metal balls bounce as it is shaken in an experiment. The narrator continues: What happens when the screen becomes the space for composing? Then word becomes one among many modes, then computing becomes becomes performing. The zoom tool translates layers, the smallest granules become the scale through which we witness the world. Then, zoomed out, the sediment is the memory of the earth. It's best not to be measured by what we’re called, but by what we do.
</p>
<p>05:57 In the background the intensity of the music continues to pick up. The sound of breathing through a SCUBA respirator can be heard. The narrator continues: Keith Sawyer says our making must be not too rigid, but not too loose: "the critical balance for innovation is 'at the edge of chaos.'”
</p>
<p>06:10 In the upper right, the metal balls bounce with more intensity. The narrator continues: Point four: the prosumer pulls like memory. The theory is the smell of bread, maybe ginger tinged or yeasty at least, warm from the oven because making is also reaching backwards. We're all intervalometers within streams of sediment gathered from sounds like stones or words like iron gone ferric in rusted bearings. Prosumer time is not just left to right but up and down. It’s a blending that ceases to be sequence and becomes instead space, playing out like sand plying and flowing, alluvial, slow combing, for a moment forgotten.
</p>
<p>07:09. In the upper right, the ball bearings bounce frantically. The sound of breathing through the SCUBA respirator can be heard. The music in the background continues to pick up in intensity. The narrator continues: Final point/first point: the prosumer has nothing to prove. As Nietzsche, tells us, "we believe that we know something about things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things" (82-83). When we recognize the makings of thought in the material world, linear time begins to loop into thing and event, noun and verb.
</p>
<p>07:41 In the lower right, the volume is turned up on the video of the figure balancing rocks. The figure works intently to balance a small rock on top of two others. The narrator continues: The prosumer no longer asks us to stake a claim. When the blossoms are coming, we feel their forward turning, the dogwood bud a capsuled blast of papered thought waiting to unfold. We compose because we, too, are turning, the soil, the eye toward flower, making arrays in the face of the abyss.
</p>
<p>08:11. In the upper right an old photograph of a figure on a 1950s bicycle appears. The narrator continues: Let the value of field one be performing. Let field two be time. Let the value of our field be becoming.
</p>
<p>08:38 The music in the background fades out. The sound of the lathe bit scraping plastic can be heard. In the lower right,the figure successfully balances the small rock on top of the others. The voice of a spectator can be heard: So cool. Wow that was so beautiful. Oh, that's amazing. Beautiful. So exciting. Thank you for letting me record it. It really feels so tribal. Like so elemental. So human. The cursor selects stop on the clips still playing on screen. The video ends.

  <p> <em>Sediment</em> includes two video compilations that have been developed
  specifically for the performance. The video, "works with materials.mp4"
  primarily includes imagery of origami folding combined with imagery of an
  outboard motor being rebuilt. Additional imagery with information on sediment
  formation is included. A number of materials from a patent application for a
  sediment intervalometer are also included as well as a personal photograph of
  the author. A second compilation brings together samples from videos showing lathing activities.</p>

  <p> The piece also repursoses two videos from prior projects. The video,
  <em>Waves</em>, which is included in this collection, provides the soundtrack
  for the piece. The video <em>Now I Have Everything I Need</em> [link] was
  developed as part of a video conversation between the author and Jason Loan.
  This conversation featured the exchange of numerous videos, which were remixed,
   shared, and developed collaboratively by the author and Loan.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<p>This video was presented at the 2012 Computers and Writing Conference. It is a
performance piece that brings together multiple videos. Three of the videos
contain compilations of imagery and sound that were created for this project. Two of
the videos (<em>Waves</em> and <em>Now I Have Everything I Need</em>) are repurposed from
earlier projects.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-left">Once one has trained one's eyes to recognize in a
scholarly treatise the scholar's intellectual idiosyncracy--every scholar has
one--and to catch it in the act, one will almost always behold behind this the
scholar's "prehistory," his family, and especially their occupations and crafts.
<span class="attribution">Friedrich Nietzsceh, <strong> The Gay Science</strong>

<p>The video suggests that the memory inside computers is partially our own.
There is a permeable boundary between the physical inscription of the memory in
the machine and the recollections of the past conjured by the scanned photograph
of a long ago boating trip, the coughing to life of the rebuilt engine, the
images, sounds, and words that move through our screens. This video creates
temporal, meaningful loops by repurposing videos from earlier projects and mixing them with
nostalgic sounds and images. The stories are true and linked with items from the
author's past: the outboard motor, the bicycle, the bee sting--the stuff
of memory. </p>

<p>These accumulated materials are woven into the video as layers (settling and
solidifying) and loops playing out in time. The music, for instance, is borrowed
from the <em>Waves</em> video recorded some months earlier. The repurposed
nature of the materials enacts the "writerly" text associated with Roland
Barthes, who suggests that meaning develops both sequentially within the text,
where it "proliferates by layering" and through correlation with "other meanings
outside the material text" (8). In <em>Sediment</em>, these intertextual correlations are
actualized as the video artifacts are integrated into the performance. No doubt,
this complicates the "reading" of the text, which, for Barthes is a good thing
as it "make[s] the reader no longer a consumer, but a producer of the text" (4).
Screen composing creates texts that evoke productive experiences for readers
even as meaning multiplies and resists closure. Thus, "forgetting meanings is
not a matter for excuses, an unfortunate defect in the performance; it is an
affirmative value" (11).


<p><em>Sediment</em> was created with a one-take performance, captured to create the
visual layer. This take also includes the background sounds. Over this layer,
the audio narration has been added. In <em>Sediment</em>, the entities emerge in flows
and loops like the steady spinning of the plastic stock on the lathe. This
emergence plays out as the performer adjusts the many windows on screen. These
performances mark what Erin Manning (following Henri Bergson) casts as duration
or "eventfulness," the experience of prehension where time passes past into
future. The pieces of <em>Sediment</em> are "composed of strands of pastness recomposing
and perishing through [the present]" (Manning 67). And though the materials are
gathered from the past, the recomposing is about the experience of bringing together
the pieces in ways that "create-with the force of movement taking form, where
what we see is a composition of holes (intervals) and wholes (pure experience,
duration) that together create a field of forces around which perception takes
form" (85). </p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">We're not talking about a simple subversion or
surface revision. We're talking about an extreme re-visioning, a fundamental
rupturing/shedding that breaks with the humanistic program altogether. We're
talking about the anticipation of and projection into a future not tethered by
the bonds of reaction, an active decision to <em>let memory go</em>. <span class="attribution">Diane Davis, <strong>Breaking up [at] Totality</strong>

<p>Manning links this form taking to feeling via the interval as "affect passes
directly through the body, coupling with the nervous system, making the interval
felt" (95). She cites the motion experiments in the images of Étienne-Jules
Marey that reveal a "force of composition" through which "affective duration is
felt" (95). For screen composers, this linking of intervals, durations, and affect
opens pathways for composing not only with mixed materials but also in registers
that include emotions and time. Manning points out the overflow of compositional
resources in these modes that are "brimming over with microperceptions,
with microexpressions never quite actualized" (95). Ultimately, "what is
produced is sensation or feeling, affective tone" (95).</p>

<p>The sound of the lathe bit biting into the plastic stock creates a loop that
drives the movement in the video. The meaning of the circular movement is hard
to pin down. The steady cutting sound evokes
experience and duration, where "the composition is not a translation: it is a
transduction of movement into sensation through the prism of the image" (95), a
transduction that creates a new mode of seeing fit for the layered and moving
windows on the screen where "what we perceive is the feeling of intensity. We
feel intensity without seeing its actual form" (96). Intensity can't be measured but can be creatively deployed through the screen.</p>

<p>The bit of the lathe makes by taking away layer after layer of plastic. A
shape emerges, a canister, a lid; add a groove for an o-ring and you have a
watertight container that can hold a timer. The sediment traps that my dad and I
put in lakes dropped a layer of Teflon powder in the collection tube every
thirty days using a timer sealed in a watertight container made by hand on a
machine lathe. The layers marked durations that themselves became/become
temporal loops folded slowly with the daily drifting of granules into the
collection tube. The sealed device was hung in the collection tube. It was
patented for marking geologic time in the sediment of lakes: the
intervalometer.</p>
