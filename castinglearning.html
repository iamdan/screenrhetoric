  <h3>Transcript</h3>

  This video was created with a screen recording of a performance on the
  computer on January 30th, 2011. An additional screen performance was captured
  on June 11th, 2011 to create an opening frame for the piece. An audio
  recording of the narration was added after the screen captures were brought
  together in a video editor. The piece showcases materials from an
  undergraduate English class called performing literature. The piece also
  includes videos hosted by YouTube that are played live in the performance,
  including a live performance of the song, "River Under African Trance" by the
  band, String Cheese Incident. The materials were curated by the author and
  three students who also developed screen recordings to reflect on their work.
  The compilation of materials was published as "Casting Learning into Flowing
  Streams" in the College Composition and Communication Online 1.1 (2012). A
  prepublication draft of the project is available at
  http://teachmix.com/tiwid/</p>

  <p>00:00 The video opens with a computer desktop. On the desktop is a text
  file with the script of the video narration, and two video player windows. The
  text file and the video players are mostly covered by a Photoshop image file
  showing a white canvas with thumbnails at the top. The cursor brings forward
  one of the video player windows. Screen cliping crosshairs appear and draw a
  rectangle over the cream-colored surface of the video window. A camera
  snapshot sound is heard. The narrator speaks:
</p>
  <p>  Welcome. This project reflects on a course that focused on digital composing
  and performance. You'll find here a collection of materials composed during
  and after the course. The project includes the creative work of many people.
  It serves as a kind of portfolio for an entire class.
</p>
    <p>00:22 After the snapshot sound, an image file appears on the desktop, and then
  is opened in photshop. Materials and windows are mixed in Photoshop, and a
  layer pallete is clicked through to create text on screen listing a title and
  authors: This is what we did in our class, Daniel Anderson, Jackyln Ngo,
  Sydney Stegall, Kyle Stevens. The narrator continue: We're calling it
  Casting Learning into Flowing Streams or This is what we did in our class.
</p>
  <p>00:32 The cursor brings a web browser window on screen. The window contains the
opening screen of a pre-publication draft of the article; thumbnails linking to
videos appear across the top and bottom of the screen. The cursor moves over the
thumbnails as the narrator continues: These screencasts capture performances as
they record activities and they include overviews and discussions performance,
portfolios, composing and creativity. These pieces at the top provide the
insights of the authors about some of the projects created in the course. The
videos reflect on student work. It's possible to move from left to right among
these, though certainly not necessary. The videos below include pieces referred
to in the discussion above. Screencasts by Austin Cooper, Sarah Brady, Sean
Mattio, Katie Meyer, Jackclyn Ngo, Austin Shaw, Sydney Stegall, Hannah Easley,
and Kelly Wollman are of two types: sample projects that represent digital
compositions exploring course text; and reflective videos created for course
portfolios.
</p>
  <p>01:28 The cursor brings forward one of the video player windows. It contains
several web browser windows. The cursor selects the play button. In the video, a cursor begins resizing a browser window.
</p>
  <p>01:39 On screen, as the web browser window is resized, a quick cut replaces the
dektop of the frame video with the desktop of the video in the video player
window, which fills the screen. The narrator
continues: The next segment of this video provide an overview of the teaching
philosophies associated with the course. It was recorded as a live performance,
with this voiceover added now. I've opened a browser window with a video by
Ronnie Tucker capturing some digital painting. And I want a soundtrack for the
performance. This is String Cheese Incident doing "River Under African Trance."
</p>
  <p>01:55 The cursor brings forward a web browser window containing a video of a
live musical performance. The cursor selects the play button. Crowd sounds, and
then music can be heard. The cursor arranges and resizes browser windows. The
narrator continues: I'm going to transform these bits to bring into view a
teaching philosophy. It's linked with digital composing, creativity, and a
studio model of the classroom. This is some pottery making by Charles Smith. I'm
bringing in some archive footage. It's called Big Trains Rolling.
</p>
  <p>02:22. The cursor brings forward a video player window that displays a title
screen reading, Shifts in Composing. The cursor selects the play button. In the
video, excerpts from student reflections are highlighted. The narrator
continues:  And this is one of my videos. It looks at student reflections on
projects created for an undergraduate class. When you finish with all of these
materials you may wonder about the course title, Introduction to Literary
Studies. Both lower and upper division students, many English majors made up the
group. The class is mostly about digital composing.
</p>
  <p>02:45 On screen, the Shifts in Composing video is enlarged and a passage of a
student reflection is highlighted. the narrator continues: Austin points out the
way the class treats words as one among many composing materials. He reflects on
a shared sense of accomplishment, and on digital projects leading to a "holistic
understanding of what it means to compose."
</p>
  <p>03:06 On screen the cursor rearranges browser windows. The narrator continues:
The class assignments call for shifts among modes. Opening the channels of sound
and image and word and motion allows new stories to be heard. And moving among
these materials creates rhetorical fluencies, spillovers, strategies,
techniques, and questions.
</p>
  <p>03:30 A new reflection excerpt is highlighted in the Shifts in Composing video.
The narrator continues:   Austin asks, "Shouldn't an English class teach us how
to utilize words more effectively? What can a video mashup teach me about
composition?" He discovers that mashups reveal familiar facets of composing. We
find brainstorming, focusing, authors, purposes: "What [do] I [want] to say?" So
old currents blend with new through digital projects.
</p>
  <p>03:57 On screen the cursor continues to arrange materials. The narrator
continues:   The teaching philosophy pushes this blending. We practice with
tools, play with genres, extend words with images or music, and discover a fluid
sense of materials and messages.
</p>
  <p>04:14 On screen a passage in a student reflection is highlighted in yellow: A
video mash-up was far closer to a composition than I had previously imagined,
and it was infinitely more fun. Working late into the night, without the endless
griping that accompanies some essays, I completed a first draft that I was quite
proud of. The narrator continues: And shifting modes does much more. It mixes up
the educational elixirs of motivation, engagement, and ownership.
</p>

  <p>04:28 On screen another reflection excerpt is highlighted: The assignment was
fascinating and exciting for me. Here, I had done something really cool. I had
composed without using a single word. I had created a work that expressed an
idea, a thesis, a concept in a new, interpretive, and creative way. Better
still, I had shared my creation with the entire world through YouTube. The
narrator continues:   We know that writing with its risks and publics can bring
a sense of authenticity. And authenticity is linked with engagement. And both
are amplified through social space. When shifting modes, projects aren't
crafted for some imagined reader. They are cast out into the world.
</p>
  <p>04:50 The cursor brings another video player window forward containing a title:
Performing in the Learning Studio. The cursor selects play and more student
reflections appear. The narrator continues:   I'm going to bring another video
into this piece. This one looks at performance, processes, and some of the
portfolio elements of the course.
</p>
  <p>05:03 The narrator continues: And let me interrupt the flow here to prepare
you for a skip. . . .
</p>
  <p>05:08 The audio track in the video briefly goes silent. The narrator continues:
--a small gap in the song. In her portfolio, Michela reflects on the way the
class was configured as an ongoing conversation, an image speaking to the
organic nature of composing and the emergent qualities of projects in the
course. The conversation is captured in part through portfolios.
</p>
  <p>05:30 On screen web pages with student portfolios appear. The narrator
continues: Here, Sydney reflects on composing a Web essay. The portfolio
captures processes and learning-that-comes-from-happenstance or
less-than-perfect projects.
</p>
  <p>05:42   The Web essay raised particular challenges with its one foot firmly
planted in written essay mode, and the other pushing students to "compose with
media." Video, image, and sound meet words--but in their native space of the
composing window.
</p>
  <p>06:03 The cursor brings another video player window forward containing the
title: Open Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity. The cursor selects
play and more student reflections appear.  The narrator continues.   Let me
bring in my third video. This one touches on affect and creativity. One of the
claims we are making is that digital composing opens new channels for sharing
stories. These channels bring new voices into scholarly conversations. Jackclyn
reports on her tactile approach to ideas. Modes of composing both enable and
limit participation. Broadening the available means makes possible the creation
and sharing of knowledge by those who otherwise might be filtered out. Channels open when shifting modes. When students moved from Web essays to
  mashups, they switched gears, discovering what Jackclyn calls "a more auditory
  and emotional mode."
</p>
  <p>06:48 On screen an excerpt from a student reflection is enlarged. Circles and
underlining highlight phrases in the excerpt. A cursor appears above the excerpt
and begins to type: I shared my own work with my friends and family in a way I'd
never shared my essays. The narrator continues:   Jackclyn moves through these channels to create
  knowledge. Her reflection speaks to her engagement with texts, with ideas, with cultural
  connections. And her willingness to share this engagment.
</p>
  <p>07:05 On screen a new student reflection appears and text is highlighted. The
narrator continues:   These shifts in affordances beg for revisions in teaching.
Hannah notes the ability to move forward once given license to make her
screencast "more about a feeling and less like an essay." We find new channels
for connecting and affective modes of communicating, allowing Hannah "to engage
with [her] tangled feelings."
</p>
  <p>07:30 On screen the cursor arranges materials. Multiple excerpts from student
reflections appear on screen. The narrator continues:   Classrooms become
studio-like environments, productive spaces where students manipulate materials
and have their say. Reflecting and speaking generates rhetorical knowledge.
</p>
  <p>07:50 On screen a passage is highlighted. The narrator continues: "Dear reader,"
Hannah says, "this note to you is the last piece of writing I will ever do as an
undergraduate. Wow. Maybe I should say the last composition, actually, since
it's more than writing. . . ."
</p>
  <p>08:06 On screen a new excerpt appears and a passage is highlighted. The narrator
continues:   Michela notes how projects strayed from expectations. Here we begin
to recognize signs of creativity. Where we see gratification and pride mixed
with frustrations we find assignments that move beyond boredom. The projects
introduce unfamiliarity and challenges. There is a heightened sense of working
with technologies and materials, of rhetorical resistance. But the challenges
and activities emerge in a collaborative, productive space and through the
ongoing composing supported by portfolios.
</p>
  <p>08:42 On screen, the cursor continues to arrange and manipulate materials. The
narrator continues:   The result is the kind of balance between frustration and
accomplishment often associated with creative endeavors--the mythical flow
state. As Katie puts it, "I got into the zone . . . I didn't even notice I'd
been sitting there for hours." We see this creative state often when working with
digital modes. Fixing a mismatched sound or struggling with a technical jam
provides a kind of material pushback that helps induce heightened engagement
(and sometimes frustration).
</p>
  <p>09:23 On screen a new excerpt appears and a passage is highlighted: I ran into
massive technical difficulties. So my screencast became about the messy process
of making itself. The narrator continues: Hannah notes how this messiness became
the focus of her composition, pointing out the freedom that comes from
"[adapting] to what [is] happening." An improvisational current flows through
the teaching philosophy. Drafts, activities, and performances become heuristic,
leading to new knowledge and furthering the development of projects.
</p>
  <p>09:54 On screen the cursor arranges materials. The narrator continues:   Such
ongoing composing also calls for new modes of reading and assessment. Again
portfolios fit well and help voices emerge. In fact, the portfolios themselves
become digital compositions developed through shifting modes.
</p>
  <p>10:14 On screen an excerpt of a reflection is enlarged and highlighted. The
narrator continues: Katie explains that she "[has] not received a single grade
on any of [her] projects." Instead, the portfolio--itself "revised many
times"--becomes the "representation of . . . work and learning." And the
philosophy redraws the boundaries of the classroom through a collaborative,
emergent, and widely public approach to composing. Works in progress are posted.
Readers respond. Writers revise. The openness and shared sense of composing
transforms relationships.
</p>
  <p>10:47 On screen exerpts from student reflections appear and passages are
highlighted. The narrator continues:   Public composing amplifies investment and
authenticity. Jacklcyn sees her screencast as akin to other class texts, calls
herself a "creator," crossing the boundary between consumer and producer of
knowledge. Digital composing is here layered with authenticity and engagement,
collaborative spaces, new channels and modes. We're shifting. Austin started us off
asking about composing. Let's watch some.
</p>
  <p>11:22 On screen two video player windows are arranged side by side and enlarged
to show excerpts from student reflections. Small, rectangular highights
emphasize passages and words in each excerpt. Passages in each are highlighted.
The narrator continues: Serendipitous, really, these clips flowing together.
Austin and Hannah thinking about feeling and voice. I'm talking about what we
did in our class. We're listening while reading pictures of audio rolling like
waves. Our "idea[s] of composition [have] changed." It has taken
attention, time, and help.
</p>
  <p>11:45 At the bottom of the screen text appears listing sources. In the web
browser window with the video with live musical performance ends. The narrator
continues:     The sound track has stopped but extensions of the performance are
beginning to build. We see them pixelated here. They echo.
</p>
  <p>12:00 On screen the cursor selects minimize buttons and windows slide off the
screen. The narrator continues: In motion they continue having their say. They
should never stop. The video ends.

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p>A major component of the video is made up of three sub-videos that have been
compiled by the author. These videos--Shifts in Composing, Performing in the
Learning Studio, and Open Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity--are
themselves made up of excerpts from student portfolios. These portfolios contain
reflections related to the project included in the publication. The three videos
have been edited to highlight excerpts from these reflections. In the recording
of the Casting Learning video, the three sub videos are played and arranged on
screen. The excerpts from student reflections are used with permission. </p>

<p>The video also includes three videos that are hosted on YouTube.  A live
performance of the song, "River Under African Trance," by the band, String
Cheese Incident, plays throughout most of the video. A video called "Big Trains
Rolling" depicts train imagery. A video called "Pottery Wheel Demonstration" and
a video called "The Valley" provide more visuals. These materials are played
live during the performance. All of the materials are mixed together to create
the new, Casting Learning piece.  </p>

<p>The piece also includes narration and the manipulation of an image file, as
well as imagery from the published article. These materials have been created by
the author and his collaborators.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> The assignments in this class . . . would not ask
students to promote a single thesis, progress through a focused argument, or
come to a (necessarily) premature conclusion. . . . In this class, students
would be invited to disrupt their own positions, to contradict themselves, to
expose all that must be hidden and excluded in the precious name of clarity. --
Breaking up at Totality 242-43 </aside>

<p>This video was created with a screen recording of a performance on the
computer on January 30th, 2011. An additional screen performance was captured on
June 11th, 2011 to create an opening frame for the piece. An audio recording of
the narration was added after the screen captures were brought together in a
video editor. The piece showcases materials from an undergraduate English class
called Performing Literature. The piece also includes videos hosted by YouTube
that are played live in the performance. The materials were curated by the
author and three students who also developed screen recordings to reflect on
their work. The compilation of materials was published as "Casting Learning into
Flowing Streams" in the College Composition and Communication Online 1.1 (2012).
<a href="http://teachmix.com/tiwid/">A prepublication draft of the project</a> is available.
</p>

<p>Diane Davis calls for a pedagogy that's transformative, dangerous even.
"Writing involves risk," she says. This pedagogy would welcome ambiguity and be
linked with authenticity and emergence. This approach disrupts the
closure-oriented modes of college, "forcing a writer constantly to double back
on herself and her 'texts,' to crack them open again to expose her own
assumptions, to reveal inconsistencies, motivations, contradictions,
limitations, incantations" (243). Student video compositions and reflections develop (with/from) genres
that challenge expectations for scholarly work. Casting Learning is itself an emergent text
built through this process, a process begun with open assignments mixed with
media.</p>

<p>Reflection is another key mode of this scholarship. Reflection opens spaces
for creativity, both in the projects under consideration and in the composition
of the reflection. This distance between project and reflection, a layering,
opens spaces for composing to emerge and offers authentic engagement with
materials. In studies of creativity, Keith Sawyer notes, "when a person knows he
or she will be rewarded for the quality of their work, they can't stop thinking
about that reward, and they find it impossible to get into the flow state where
they're doing the task simply because they like doing it" (53). The  videos
included in Casting Learning carve out their own conventions for the genres of
media reflection. This experimentation opens spaces where new forms and
engagements with materials play out. This composing is performative,
improvisational, happening "in a zone between complete predictability and being
out of control" (253). The student voices in Casting Learning describe the
results: "I got into the zone . . . I didn't even notice I'd been sitting there
for hours."</p>

<p></P>
<aside class="pullquote-right">How are these alternatives invented? One element
of the practice is the manifesto, amounting to a discourse on method--a rhetoric
or poetics--for a new genre or mode of production: a program of experimentation.
In teaching theory heuretically a seminar tries out some of these vanguard
poetics. -- Heuretics xii </aside>

<p>Emergent composing in mediated spaces with ambiguity creates the poetics
expressed by Gregory Ulmer in his book, <em>Heuretics</em>. Here, a composition
is "an <em>experiment</em>: it is offered not as a proof or assertion of truth
but as a trial or test" (38) Ulmer cites Julia Kristeva in describing "a space
that is neither that of propositional knowledge nor commonsense opinion. This
boundary or frontier (interface) calls for invention conducted as a
transgression of the rules." We find "passages" between systems of meaning that
call into question "classic mimesis, argumentation, judgment, realism" (176). As
familiar sense and intelligibility break down, meaning must "be approached
indirectly, by extended analogies" (67), an approach that "collapses the
distinction between concrete and abstract" (128) until the "boundary or frontier
(interface) function of chora on the verge of language is glimpsed through
artistic, poetic practices" (176). </p>

<p>This heuretics traces from Plato to Kristeva to Derrida to Ulmer and beyond
through discussions of chora. We find a fit between this kind of composing and
alternative scholarship as "chorography promises something more than just an
alternative to concept formation as a way to organize data into meaningful sets.
It promises also to engage the users' premises in the process of learning,
opening a mutually transforming circuit between judgment and theory" (202). This
circuit is extended as seeing, hearing, reading, thinking, producing, consuming
co-emerge through screen composing. We experience these passages and circuits
when we perform this composing. The moments link feeling with judgment and evoke
insights and the joy of the sublime (Ulmer 143). And they offer a corrective to a
logic of print that "favors and supports or augments an analytical mode of
thought based on . . . the abstract demands of logic" (140). Instead, screen
composing supposes that bringing together media through emergent mixing
promotes a mode of thinking in which judgments "have been rendered ambiguous,
uncertain, undecidable" (214).
