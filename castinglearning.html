  <h3>Transcript</h3>


This video is a screen recording of a performance. It includes several video
compilations of student reflections. Passages from the reflections are
highlighted as the videos play. The piece also includes videos that provide
visuals and a soundtrack for the performance. </p>

<p>00:00 The video opens with a computer desktop. On the desktop is a text file
with the script of the video narration, and two video player windows. The text
file and the video players are mostly covered by a Photoshop file showing
a white canvas with thumbnails at the top. The cursor brings forward one of the
video player windows. Screen clipping crosshairs appear and draw a rectangle
over the cream-colored surface of the video window. A camera snapshot sound is
heard. The narrator speaks: “Welcome. This project reflects on a course that
focused on digital composing and performance. You'll find here a collection of
materials composed during and after the course. The project includes the
creative work of many people. It serves as a kind of portfolio for an entire
class.” </p>

<p>00:22 After the snapshot sound, materials and windows are mixed in Photoshop,
and a layer palette is clicked through to create text on screen, listing a title
and authors: “This is what we did in our class, Daniel Anderson, Jackclyn Ngo,
Sydney Stegall, Kyle Stevens.” The narrator continues: “We're calling it
‘Casting Learning into Flowing Streams,’ or, ‘This is what we did in our
class.’” </p>

<p>00:32 The cursor brings a web browser window on screen; thumbnails linking to
videos appear across the top and bottom of the screen. The cursor moves over the
thumbnails, revealing short descriptions, as the narrator continues: “These
screencasts capture performances as they record activities and they include
overviews and discussions of performance, portfolios, composing, and creativity.
These pieces at the top provide the insights of the authors about some of the
projects created in the course. The videos reflect on student work. It's
possible to move from left to right among these, though certainly not necessary.
The videos below include pieces referred to in the discussion above. Screencasts
by Austin Cooper, Sarah Brady, Sean Mattio, Katie Meyer, Jackclyn Ngo, Austin
Shaw, Sydney Stegall, Hannah Easley, and Kelly Wollman are of two types: sample
projects that represent digital composing and reflective videos created for
course portfolios. </p>

<p>01:28 The cursor brings forward one of the video player windows. It contains
several web browser windows, which the cursor navigates and resizes. The
narrator continues: “The next segment of this video provides an overview of the
teaching philosophies associated with the course. It was recorded as a live
performance, with this voiceover added now. I've opened a browser window with a
video by Ronnie Tucker, capturing some digital painting. And I want a soundtrack
for the performance. This is String Cheese Incident doing ‘River Under African
Trance.’” </p>

<p>01:55 Crowd sounds, and then music, can be heard. The cursor arranges and
resizes browser windows. The narrator continues: “I'm going to transform these
bits to bring into view a teaching philosophy. It's linked with digital
composing, creativity, and a studio model of the classroom. This is some pottery
making by Charles Smith. I'm bringing in some archive footage. It's called ‘Big
Trains Rolling.’” </p>

<p>02:22. The cursor brings forward a video player window that displays a title
screen reading, “Shifts in Composing.” The video highlights student
reflections. The narrator continues:  “And this is one of my videos. It looks at
student reflections on projects created for the undergraduate class. When you
finish with all of these materials, you may wonder about the course title,
“Introduction to Literary Studies.” Both lower and upper division students, many
English majors made up the group. The class is mostly about digital composing.
</p>

<p>02:45 On screen, the “Shifts in Composing” video is enlarged and a passage of
a student reflection is highlighted. The narrator comments on the passage:
“Austin points out the way the class treats words as one among many composing
materials. He reflects on a shared sense of accomplishment, and on digital
projects leading to a ‘holistic understanding of what it means to compose.’”
</p>

<p>03:06 On screen, the cursor rearranges browser windows. The narrator
continues: “The class assignments call for shifts among modes. Opening the
channels of sound and image, word and motion, allows new stories to be heard.
And moving among these materials creates rhetorical fluencies, spillovers,
strategies, techniques, and questions.” </p>

<p>03:30 A new reflection excerpt is highlighted. The narrator continues: “Austin
asks, ‘shouldn't an English class teach us how to utilize words more
effectively? What can a video mashup teach me about composition?’ He discovers
that mashups reveal familiar facets of composing. We find brainstorming,
focusing, authors, purposes--‘What [do] I [want] to say?’ So old currents blend
with new through digital projects.” </p>

<p>03:57 On screen windows are rearranged and resized. The narrator continues:
"The teaching philosophy pushes this blending. We practice with tools, play with
genres, extend words with images or music, and discover a fluid sense of
materials and messages.” </p>

<p>04:14 A passage in a student reflection is highlighted in yellow: “A video
mashup was far closer to a composition than I had previously imagined, and it
was infinitely more fun. Working late into the night, without the endless
griping that accompanies some essays, I completed a first draft that I was quite
proud of.” The narrator continues: “And shifting modes does much more. It mixes
up the educational elixirs of motivation and engagement.” </p>

<p>04:28 Another reflection excerpt is highlighted: "The assignment was
fascinating and exciting for me. Here, I had done something really cool. I had
composed without using a single word. I had created a work that expressed an
idea, a thesis, a concept in a new, interpretive, and creative way. Better
still, I had shared my creation with the entire world through YouTube.” The
narrator continues: “We know that writing with its risks and publics can bring a
sense of authenticity. And authenticity is linked with engagement. And both are
amplified through social space. When shifting modes, projects aren't crafted for
some imagined reader. They are cast out into the world.” </p>

<p>04:50 Another video player window comes forward, titled “Performing in the
Learning Studio.” More student reflections appear. The narrator continues: “I'm
going to bring another video into this piece. This one looks at performance,
processes, and some of the portfolio elements of the course. And let me
interrupt the flow here to prepare you for a skip. . . .” </p>

<p>05:08 The audio track in the video briefly goes silent. The narrator
continues: ”A small gap in the song. In her portfolio, Michela reflects on the
way the class was configured as an ongoing conversation, an image speaking to
the organic nature of composing and the emergent qualities of projects in the
course. The conversation is captured in part through portfolios. Here, Sydney
reflects on composing a Web essay. The portfolio captures processes and
learning that comes from happenstance or less-than-perfect projects. The web
essay raised particular challenges with its one foot firmly planted in written
essay mode, and the other pushing students to ‘compose with media.’ Video,
image, and sound meet words--but in their native space of the composing window.”
</p>

<p>06:03 The cursor brings another video player window forward, titled “Open Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity.” More student
reflections appear, highlighted or resized to accompany the words of the
narrator: “Let me bring in my third video. This one touches on affect and
creativity. One of the claims we are making is that digital composing opens new
channels for sharing stories. These channels bring new voices into scholarly
conversations. Jackclyn reports on her tactile approach to ideas. Modes of
composing both enable and limit participation. Broadening the available means
makes possible the creation and sharing of knowledge by those who otherwise
might be filtered out. Channels open when shifting modes. When students moved
from web essays to mashups, they switched gears, discovering what Jackclyn calls
‘a more auditory and emotional mode.’” </p>

<p>06:48 On screen, an excerpt from a student reflection is enlarged. Circles and
underlining highlight phrases in the excerpt. A cursor appears above the excerpt
and begins to type: “I shared my own work with my friends and family in a way
I'd never shared my essays.” The narrator continues: “Jackclyn moves through
these channels to create knowledge. Her reflection speaks to her engagement with
texts, with ideas, with cultural connections, and her willingness to share this
engagement.” </p>

<p>07:05 On screen, a new student reflection appears among the other continually
playing videos and text is again highlighted. The narrator continues: “These
shifts in affordances beg for revisions in teaching. Hannah notes the ability to
move forward once given license to make her screencast ‘more about a feeling and
less like an essay.’ We find new channels for connecting and affective modes of
communicating, allowing Hannah ‘to engage with [her] tangled feelings.’” </p>

<p>07:30 On screen, the cursor rearranges and resizes windows. Multiple excerpts
from student reflections appear on screen. The narrator continues: “Classrooms
become studio-like environments, productive spaces, where students manipulate
materials and have their say. Reflecting and speaking generates rhetorical
knowledge.” </p>

<p>07:50 The screen zooms into a particular window, where a passage is
highlighted. The narrator continues: "’Dear reader,’ Hannah says, ‘this note to
you is the last piece of writing I will ever do as an undergraduate. Wow. Maybe
I should say the last composition, actually, since it's more than writing. . . .’”
</p>

<p>08:06 A new excerpt appears, replacing Hannah’s, and a passage is highlighted.
The narrator continues: “Michela notes how projects strayed from expectations.
Here, we begin to recognize signs of creativity. Where we see gratification and
pride mixed with frustration, we find assignments that move beyond boredom. The
projects introduce unfamiliarity and challenges. There is a heightened sense of
working with technologies and materials, of rhetorical resistance. But the
challenges and activities emerge in a collaborative, productive space and
through the ongoing composing supported by portfolios.” </p>

<p>08:42 On screen, the cursor continues to arrange and manipulate windows and materials,
including adjusting the font size in a text file. The narrator continues: “The
result is the kind of balance between frustration and accomplishment often
associated with creative endeavors--the mythical ‘flow state.’ As Katie puts it,
‘I got into the zone . . . I didn't even notice I'd been sitting there for
hours.’ We see this creative state often when working with digital modes. Fixing
a mismatched sound or struggling with a technical jam provides a kind of
material pushback that helps induce heightened engagement (and sometimes
frustration).” </p>

<p>09:23 Hannah’s reflection appears on screen again, with some text
highlighted: “I ran into massive technical difficulties. So my screencast became
about the messy process of making itself.” The narrator comments on her
experience: “Hannah notes how this messiness became the focus of her
composition, pointing out the freedom that comes from ‘[adapting] to what [is]
happening.’” </p>

<p> 9:35 The screen displays many different windows, some containing student
texts and others showing videos hosted on YouTube or student-created graphics. The narrator
continues: “An improvisational current flows through the teaching philosophy.
Drafts, activities, and performances become heuristic, leading to new knowledge
and furthering the development of projects. Such ongoing composing also calls
for new modes of reading and assessment. Again, portfolios fit well and help
voices emerge. In fact, the portfolios themselves become digital compositions
developed through shifting modes.” </p>

<p>10:14 On screen, an excerpt of a reflection is enlarged and highlighted. The
narrator continues: “Katie explains that she ‘[has] not received a single grade
on any of [her] projects.’ Instead, the portfolio itself--revised many
times--becomes the ‘representation of . . . work and learning.’ And the
philosophy redraws the boundaries of the classroom through a collaborative,
emergent, and widely public approach to composing. Works in progress are posted.
Readers respond. Writers revise. The openness and shared sense of composing
transforms relationships." </p>

<p>10:47 Another student reflection fills the screen. The narrator
continues: “Public composing amplifies investment and authenticity. Jackclyn
sees her screencast as akin to other class texts, calls herself a
‘creator’--crossing the boundary between consumer and producer of knowledge.
Digital composing is here layered with authenticity and engagement,
collaborative spaces, new channels and modes. We're shifting. Austin started us
off asking about composing. Let's watch some.” </p>

<p>11:22 On screen, two video player windows are arranged side by side and
enlarged to show excerpts from student reflections. Small, rectangular
callouts highlight phrases and words in each excerpt. The narrator continues: “Serendipitous, really, these clips flowing
together. Austin and Hannah, thinking about feeling and voice. I'm talking about
what we did in our class. We're listening while reading pictures of audio
rolling like waves. Our ‘idea[s] of composition [have] changed.’ It has taken
attention, time, and help.” </p>

<p>11:45 The multiple windows again fill the screen. The video featuring the
live musical performance ends. The narrator continues: “The sound track has
stopped, but extensions of the performance are beginning to build. We see them
pixelated here. They echo." </p>

<p>12:00 On screen, the cursor selects minimize buttons and windows slide off the
screen. The narrator continues: “In motion they continue having their say. They
should never stop.” The video ends.</p>

  <p>The core materials of the video include three sub-videos that have been
  compiled by the author. These videos--"Shifts in Composing," "Performing in the
  Learning Studio," and "Open Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity"--are
  themselves made up of excerpts from student portfolios. The three videos
  have been edited to highlight excerpts from student reflections, used with permission. </p>

  <p>The video also includes three videos that are hosted on YouTube.  A live
  performance of the song, "River Under African Trance," by the band, String
  Cheese Incident, plays throughout most of the video. A video called "Big Trains
  Rolling" depicts train imagery. A video called "Pottery Wheel Demonstration" and
  a video called "The Valley" provide more visuals.  </p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> The assignments in this class . . . would not ask
students to promote a single thesis, progress through a focused argument, or
come to a (necessarily) premature conclusion. . . . In this class, students
would be invited to disrupt their own positions, to contradict themselves, to
expose all that must be hidden and excluded in the precious name of clarity. <span class="attribution">Diane Davis,
<strong>Breaking up [at] Totality</strong> (242-43) </span> </aside>

<p>This video is a screen recording of a performance on the
computer on January 30th, 2011. An additional screen performance was captured on
June 11th, 2011 to create an opening frame for the piece. An audio recording of
the narration was added after the screen captures were combined. The piece showcases materials from an undergraduate English class
called, Performing Literature. <em>Casting Learning</em> also includes videos hosted by YouTube
that are played live in the performance. The video (along with others) was curated by the
author and three students and published as "Casting Learning into
Flowing Streams" in <em>College Composition and Communication Online</em> 1.1 (2012).
<a href="http://teachmix.com/tiwid/">A prepublication draft of the project</a> is available.
</p>

<p>Diane Davis calls for a pedagogy that's transformative, dangerous even.
"Writing involves risk," she says. This pedagogy would welcome ambiguity and be
linked with authenticity and emergence. This approach disrupts the
closure-oriented modes of college, "forcing a writer constantly to double back
on herself and her 'texts,' to crack them open again to expose her own
assumptions, to reveal inconsistencies, motivations, contradictions,
limitations, incantations" (243). Student screen compositions and reflections develop (with/from) genres
that challenge expectations for scholarly work. <em>Casting Learning</em> is itself an emergent text
built through this process, a process begun by asking students to compose video scholarship.</p>

<p>Reflection is a key mode of this scholarship. Reflection opens spaces for
creativity, both in the projects under consideration and in the composition of
the reflection itself. This distance between project and reflection, a layering, opens
spaces for authentic engagement with materials and creative response to emerge.
In studies of creativity, Keith Sawyer notes, "when a person knows he or she
will be rewarded for the quality of their work, they can't stop thinking about
that reward, and they find it impossible to get into the flow state where
they're doing the task simply because they like doing it" (53). The  videos
included in <em>Casting Learning</em> carve out their own conventions for the
genres of screen composing using reflection. This experimentation opens spaces
where students can return to creatively revisit their own texts. This composing
is performative, improvisational, happening "in a zone between complete
predictability and being out of control" (253). The student voices in
<em>Casting Learning</em> describe the results: "I got into the zone . . . I
didn't even notice I'd been sitting there for hours."</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">How are these alternatives invented? One element
of the practice is the manifesto, amounting to a discourse on method--a rhetoric
or poetics--for a new genre or mode of production: a program of experimentation.
In teaching theory heuretically, a seminar tries out some of these vanguard
poetics. <span class="attribution">Gregory Ulmer, <strong>Heuretics</strong> (xii) </span> </aside>

<p>Emergent composing in mediated spaces with ambiguity creates the poetics
expressed by Gregory Ulmer in his book, <em>Heuretics</em>. Here, a composition
is "an <em>experiment</em>: it is offered not as a proof or assertion of truth
but as a trial or test" (38). Ulmer cites Julia Kristeva in describing "a space
that is neither that of propositional knowledge nor commonsense opinion. This
boundary or frontier (interface) calls for invention conducted as a
transgression of the rules." We find "passages" between systems of meaning that
call into question "classic mimesis, argumentation, judgment, realism" (176). As
familiar sense and intelligibility break down, meaning must "be approached
indirectly, by extended analogies" (67), an approach that "collapses the
distinction between concrete and abstract" (128) until the "boundary or frontier
(interface) function of chora on the verge of language is glimpsed through
artistic, poetic practices" (176). </p>

<p>This heuretics traces from Plato to Kristeva to Derrida to Ulmer and beyond
through discussions of chora. We find a fit between this kind of composing and
video scholarship as "chorography promises something more than just an
alternative to concept formation as a way to organize data into meaningful sets.
It promises also to engage the users' premises in the process of learning,
opening a mutually transforming circuit between judgment and theory" (202). This
circuit is extended as seeing, hearing, reading, thinking, producing, consuming
co-emerge through screen composing. We experience these passages and circuits
when we perform this composing. The moments link feeling with judgment and evoke
insights and the joy of the sublime (Ulmer 143). And they offer a corrective to a
logic of print that "favors and supports or augments an analytical mode of
thought based on . . . the abstract demands of logic" (140). Instead, screen
composing supposes that bringing together media through emergent mixing
promotes a mode of thinking in which judgments "have been rendered ambiguous,
uncertain, undecidable" (214).
