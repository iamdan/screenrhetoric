    This video is a screen recording captured on January 30, 2011. An
    additional screen performance was captured on June 11, 2011 to create an
    opening frame for the piece. An audio recording of the narration was added
    after the screen captures were combined. The piece showcases materials from
    an undergraduate introductory literature class. The video (along with
    others) was curated by the author and three students and published as
"Casting Learning into Flowing Streams" in <em>College Composition and Communication Online</em> 1.1 (2012).
    <a href="http://altscholarship.com/tiwid/">
        A prepublication draft of the project
    </a>
    is available.
</p>
<p>
    Casting Learning includes several student video reflections. Passages from
    the reflections are highlighted in several compilation videos, which are
    played in the captured piece. It also includes a video with a musical
    performance as well as videos with footage of trains, pottery making, and
    work with a computer painting program. The video also includes a narration
    track that discusses aspects of learning and guides viewers through these
    materials.
</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>
    00:00 The video opens with a computer desktop. On the desktop is a text
    file with the script of the video narration, and two video player windows.
    The text file and the video players are mostly covered by a Photoshop file
    showing a white canvas with thumbnails at the top. The cursor brings
    forward one of the video player windows. Screen clipping crosshairs appear
    and draw a rectangle over the cream-colored surface of the video window. A
    camera shutter sound is heard. The narrator speaks:
    "Welcome. This project reflects on a course that focused on digital
    composing and performance. You'll find here a collection of materials
    composed during and after the course. The project includes the creative
    work of many people. It serves as a kind of portfolio for an entire class."
</p>
<p>
    00:22 After the shutter sound, materials and windows are mixed in
    Photoshop, and a layer palette is clicked through to create text on screen,
    listing a title and authors: "This is what we did in our class, Daniel
    Anderson, Jackclyn Ngo, Sydney Stegall, Kyle Stevens." The narrator
    continues: "We're calling it 'Casting Learning into Flowing Streams,' or
    'This is what we did in our class.'"
</p>
<p>
    00:32 The cursor brings a web browser window on screen; thumbnails linking
    to videos appear across the top and bottom of the browser window. The
    cursor moves over the thumbnails, revealing short descriptions, as the
    narrator continues: "These screencasts capture performances as they record
    activities, and they include overviews and discussions of performance,
    portfolios, composing, and creativity. These pieces at the top provide the
    insights of the authors about some of the projects created in the course.
    The videos reflect on student work. It's possible to move from left to
    right among these, though certainly not necessary. The videos below include
    pieces referred to in the discussion above. Screencasts by Austin Cooper,
    Sarah Brady, Sean Mattio, Katie Meyer, Jackclyn Ngo, Austin Shaw, Sydney
    Stegall, Hannah Easley, and Kelly Wollman are of two types: sample projects
    that represent digital composing and reflective videos created for course
    portfolios.
</p>
<p>
    01:28 The cursor brings forward one of the video player windows. It
    contains several web browser windows, which the cursor navigates and
    resizes. The narrator continues: "The next segment of this video provides
    an overview of the teaching philosophies associated with the course. It was
    recorded as a live performance, with this voiceover added now. I've opened
    a browser window with a video by Ronnie Tucker, capturing some digital
    painting. And I want a soundtrack for the performance. This is String
    Cheese Incident doing 'River under African Trance.'"
</p>
<p>
    01:55 Crowd sounds, and then music, can be heard. The cursor arranges and
    resizes browser windows. The narrator continues: "I'm going to transform
    these bits to bring into view a teaching philosophy. It's linked with
    digital composing, creativity, and a studio model of the classroom. This is
    some pottery making by Charles Smith. I'm bringing in some archive footage.
    It's called 'Big Trains Rolling.'"
</p>
<p>
    02:22. The cursor brings forward a video player window that displays a
    title reading "Shifts in Composing." The narrator continues: "And this is
    one of my videos. It looks at student reflections on projects created for
    the undergraduate class. When you finish with all of these materials, you
    may wonder about the course title, Introduction to Literary Studies. Both
    lower and upper division students, many English majors, made up the group.
    The class is mostly about digital composing."
</p>
<p>
    02:45 On screen, the "Shifts in Composing" video is enlarged and a passage
    of a student reflection is highlighted. The student reflection reads:
    "Instead of a straight up reading and writing style English course, this
    seminar asked us to mix mediums and to compose without words. Rather than
    adding to the trillions of pages of subpar essays written by students since
    the dawn of time, we created videos, presentations, and interactive web
    essays." The narrator comments on the passage: "Austin points out the way
    the class treats words as one among many composing materials. He reflects
    on a shared sense of accomplishment, and on digital projects leading to a
    'holistic understanding of what it means to compose.'"
</p>
<p>
    03:06 On screen, the cursor rearranges browser windows. The narrator
    continues: "The class assignments call for shifts among modes. Opening the
    channels of sound and image, word and motion, allows new stories to be
    heard. And moving among these materials creates rhetorical fluencies,
    spillovers, strategies, techniques, and questions."
</p>
<p>
    03:30 A new reflection excerpt is highlighted; it reads: "While the web
    essay assignment still contained some semblance to traditional
    composition—a strong written component—this assignment seemed to come
    straight from the Communications Department. I had many questions,
    Shouldn't an English class teach us how to utilize words more effectively?
    What can a video mashup teach me about composition? Where do I possibly
    begin to do this assignment?" The narrator continues: "Austin asks,
    'Shouldn't an English class teach us how to utilize words more effectively?
    What can a video mashup teach me about composition?'"
</p>
<p>
    03:44 The page with the student reflection is scrolled down, and a new
    passage is highlighted: "I had a much more difficult time choosing a topic.
    I could not decide what it is I wanted to say. This I realized was exactly
    like composing in the traditional way, just like the creative process of
    writing: there was a multitude of brainstorming; I had to decide on a
    'thesis' for my mashup, what I wanted to say or prove." The narrator
    continues: "He discovers that mashups reveal familiar facets of composing.
    We find brainstorming, focusing, authors, purposes—'What [do] I [want] to
    say?' So old currents blend with new through digital projects."
</p>
<p>
    03:57 On screen, windows are rearranged and resized. The page with the
    student reflection is scrolled down, and a new passage is highlighted: "At
    this point in the process, the mashup's relation to composing became
    clearer, and my definition of composition began to shift. Here I had
    developed [a] thesis I was seeking to prove; I was exploring with different
    tools (formatting); choosing my music, images, and effects carefully (word
    choice); and I was going to the original sources for material (quotes)."
    The narrator continues: "The teaching philosophy pushes this blending. We
    practice with tools, play with genres, extend words with images or music,
    and discover a fluid sense of materials and messages."
</p>
<p>
    04:14 A passage in the student reflection is highlighted in yellow: "A
    video mashup was far closer to a composition than I had previously
    imagined, and it was infinitely more fun. Working late into the night,
    without the endless griping that accompanies some essays, I completed a
    first draft that I was quite proud of." The narrator continues: "And
    shifting modes does much more. It mixes up the educational elixirs of
    motivation and engagement."
</p>
<p>
    04:28 Another excerpt in the student reflection is highlighted: "The
    assignment was fascinating and exciting for me. Here, I had done something
    really cool. I had composed without using a single word. I had created a
    work that expressed an idea, a thesis, a concept in a new, interpretive,
    and creative way. Better still, I had shared my creation with the entire
    world through YouTube." The narrator continues: "We know that writing with
    its risks and publics can bring a sense of authenticity. And authenticity
    is linked with engagement. And both are amplified through social space.
    When shifting modes, projects aren't crafted for some imagined reader. They
    are cast out into the world." On screen, another excerpt from the student
    reflection is highlighted: "If nothing else, the assignment was different
    and proved that qualifying as 'composition' does not depend on words, but
    rather on the successful conveyance of ideas. And as for effectiveness,
    whether it was because of the medium or because it was new and different
    people noticed it more; I noticed it more. While I never send my essays
    around to my friends to read, I emailed this video to everyone. So perhaps,
    this was more effective than writing an essay because instead of saying
    something, I showed it and people looked."
</p>
<p>
    04:50 Another video player window comes forward, titled "Performing in the
    Learning Studio." More student reflections appear. A passage is
    highlighted: "This class was by far the most interesting and rewarding
    English class I have experienced at UNC. Professor Anderson introduced a
    whole new style of teaching and learning, which proved to be much more of a
    class conversation, and a process, than any of my previous classes." The
    narrator continues: "I'm going to bring another video into this piece. This
    one looks at performance, processes, and some of the portfolio elements of
    the course. And let me interrupt the flow here to prepare you for a skip. .
    . ."
</p>
<p>
    05:08 The audio track in the video briefly goes silent. The narrator
    continues: "A small gap in the song. In her portfolio, Michela reflects on
    the way the class was configured as an ongoing conversation, an image
    speaking to the organic nature of composing and the emergent qualities of
    projects in the course. The conversation is captured in part through
    portfolios." On screen, an excerpt from a student reflection is
    highlighted: "This project primarily taught me the importance of
    self-examination in the writing process. If I had been able to step away
    from the essay when first writing it, I would have seen that my thesis
    attempted to connect too many ideas. Now I can see the shortcomings of the
    essay, but in all honesty, I still am not fully able to get past them." The
    narrator continues: "Here, Sydney reflects on composing a web essay. The
    portfolio captures processes and learning that comes from happenstance or
    less-than-perfect projects. The web essay raised particular challenges with
    its one foot firmly planted in written essay mode, and the other pushing
    students to 'compose with media.' Video, image, and sound meet words—but in
    their native space of the composing window."
</p>
<p>
    06:03 The cursor brings another video player window forward, titled "Open
    Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity." More student reflections
    appear, highlighted or resized to accompany the words of the narrator: "Let
    me bring in my third video. This one touches on affect and creativity. One
    of the claims we are making is that digital composing opens new channels
    for sharing stories. These channels bring new voices into scholarly
    conversations." On screen, an excerpt from a student reflection is
    highlighted: "[The fact that] our class would be centered on
    technology-based projects was extremely appealing. I am a tactile,
    product-driven learner; I love to manipulate ideas with my hands and eyes
    and do much better working toward the end goal of a visible or tangible
    product instead of a pen and paper test grade. Twenty years from now, I
    will not show off an exam grade, but I will certainly still retrieve my
    digital videos and broadcast them." The narrator continues: "Jackclyn
    reports on her tactile approach to ideas. Modes of composing both enable
    and limit participation. Broadening the available means makes possible the
    creation and sharing of knowledge by those who otherwise might be filtered
    out. Channels open when shifting modes. When students moved from web essays
    to mashups, they switched gears, discovering what Jackclyn calls 'a more
    auditory and emotional mode.'" In a student reflection, a passage is
    highlighted: "I had to switch gears from words and images to a more
    auditory and emotional mode in completing our next assignment."
</p>
<p>
    06:48 On screen, an excerpt from a student reflection is enlarged. Circles
    and underlining highlight phrases in the excerpt. A cursor appears above
    the excerpt and begins to type: "I shared my own work with my friends and
    family in a way I'd never shared my essays." The narrator continues:
    "Jackclyn moves through these channels to create knowledge. Her reflection
    speaks to her engagement with texts, with ideas, with cultural connections,
    and her willingness to share this engagement."
</p>
<p>
    07:05 On screen, a new student reflection appears among the other
    continually playing videos, and text is again highlighted: "Once Professor
    Anderson explained that it could be more about a feeling, and less like an
    essay, I was good to go. I really liked the idea of finding a way to engage
    with some of my tangled feelings about the book." The narrator continues:
    "These shifts in affordances beg for revisions in teaching. Hannah notes
    the ability to move forward once given license to make her screencast 'more
    about a feeling and less like an essay.' We find new channels for
    connecting and affective modes of communicating, allowing Hannah 'to engage
    with [her] tangled feelings.'"
</p>
<p>
    07:30 On screen, the cursor rearranges and resizes windows. Multiple
excerpts from student reflections appear. One reads: "I got really into    <strong> </strong>the process of video editing. It was very time consuming,
    but I also found it rewarding. It reminded me of the labor intensive
    processes from some of my studio art classes, like developing photographs
    or working with a printing press. I loved the way I could manipulate the
    clips and say whatever I wanted." The narrator continues: "Classrooms
    become studio-like environments, productive spaces where students
    manipulate materials and have their say. Reflecting and speaking generates
    rhetorical knowledge."
</p>
<p>
    07:50 The screen zooms into a particular window, where a passage is
    highlighted. The narrator reads the passage: "'Dear reader,' Hannah says,
    'this note to you is the last piece of writing I will ever do as an
    undergraduate. Wow. Maybe I should say the last composition, actually,
    since it's more than writing. . . .'"
</p>
<p>
    08:06 A new excerpt from a student reflection appears, replacing Hannah's,
    and yellow marker highlights several phrases: "[English majors] are well
    accustomed to writing analytical papers. . . . But our projects strayed
    from this standard format in exciting and intimidating ways. This was
    extremely gratifying, but also very frustrating at times. This class was
    intriguingly self-reflective, ultimately an ongoing conversation about
    communication and how to better learn in a classroom setting. I immensely
    enjoyed . . . creative projects that I will have forever." The narrator
    continues: "Michela notes how projects strayed from expectations. Here, we
    begin to recognize signs of creativity. Where we see gratification and
    pride mixed with frustration, we find assignments that move beyond boredom.
    The projects introduce unfamiliarity and challenges. There is a heightened
    sense of working with technologies and materials, of rhetorical
    resistance."
</p>
<p>
    08:30 On screen, an excerpt from a student reflection is highlighted: "It
    turns out that 'Performing Literature' is unlike any class I've taken
    before. We looked at the idea of communication as something much broader
    than writing alone, and at the role technology plays in the way we
    communicate. Projects like the mashup and the screencast involved a
    philosophy of composition much closer to the ones we'd discussed in my art
    classes than my English ones. These projects brought up an idea I hadn't
    thought on before: how to get people to engage with the material you
    create. I'd always just assumed that no one but my teacher was going to
    read my essay about parallel structure in Donne's sermons. (And, in fact, I
    think it's safe to say that no one else did.) But something like a
    screencast enables you to present information in a way that engages people
    much more fully. I spent a lot of time watching my classmates' mashups and
    screencasts, and I shared my own work with my friends and family in a way
    I'd never shared my essays. Although the essay will always have a special
    place in my heart, and a special function, I think it's a fantastic idea to
    explore different ways of presenting ideas that might get a wider audience.
    Most of all, I think this class helped me to broaden my idea of what it
    means to have a scholarly discussion. My engagement with literature doesn't
    have to stop after college. It can happen on YouTube, or a discussion
    thread, or even (of course) face to face." The narrator continues: "But the
    challenges and activities emerge in a collaborative, productive space and
    through the ongoing composing supported by portfolios."
</p>
<p>
    08:42 On screen, the cursor continues to arrange and manipulate windows and
    materials, including adjusting the font size in a text file to reveal the
    text of another student reflection: "I got into 'the zone' much as I do
    when working on my paintings or other art for my Studio Art classes, and I
    didn't even notice I'd been sitting there for hours making it! I think this
    medium is much more comparable to creating an art piece or composing music
    in that there are few limitations or restrictions and it capitalizes on
    creativity and an artistic eye." The narrator continues: "The result is the
    kind of balance between frustration and accomplishment often associated
    with creative endeavors—the mythical 'flow state.' As Katie puts it, 'I got
    into the zone . . . I didn't even notice I'd been sitting there for
    hours.'" On screen an excerpt from a student reflection is highlighted: "I
    also managed to find a clip that made the loud banging sound about halfway
    through the trailer make sense. Before, it sounded random, but now the
    fiancé character looks as if he hears the noise, then turns and sees a hand
    at the window." The narrator continues: "We see this creative state often
    when working with digital modes. Fixing a mismatched sound or struggling
    with a technical jam provides a kind of material pushback that helps induce
    heightened engagement (and sometimes frustration)."
</p>
<p>
    09:23 A new student reflection appears on screen, with some text
    highlighted: "I ran into massive technical difficulties. So my screencast
    became about the messy process of making itself. I actually had a lot of
    fun with it. It was pretty freeing to just give up some control, and adapt
    to what was happening." The narrator continues: "Hannah notes how this
    messiness became the focus of her composition, pointing out the freedom
    that comes from '[adapting] to what [is] happening.'"
</p>
<p>
    9:35 The screen displays many different windows, some containing student
    texts and others showing videos hosted on YouTube or student-created
    graphics. In a student text, a passage is highlighted: "Doing the Prezi and
    group presentation really helped us to focus our idea, and to figure out
    what needed work in our analysis. Our presentation had a much more
    meaningful analysis than our first draft. I think it did a better job of
    answering the ever-present question of "So what?" The narrator continues:
    "An improvisational current flows through the teaching philosophy. Drafts,
    activities, and performances become heuristic, leading to new knowledge and
    furthering the development of projects. Such ongoing composing also calls
    for new modes of reading and assessment. Again, portfolios fit well and
    help voices emerge. In fact, the portfolios themselves become digital
    compositions developed through shifting modes."
</p>
<p>
    10:14 On screen, an excerpt of a reflection is enlarged and highlighted:
    "This course has also placed a strong emphasis on revision. As an English
    major, I'm accustomed to the long process of editing. But Professor
    Anderson has taken revising a step further in this course. As the Fall
    semester draws to a close, I have not received a single grade on any of
    these projects. There have been due dates, but they were all deadlines for
    drafts. This portfolio (which has been revised itself many times) will be
    graded as a representation of all my work and learning for the semester."
    The narrator continues: "Katie explains that she '[has] not received a
    single grade on any of [her] projects.' Instead, the portfolio
    itself—revised many times—becomes the 'representation of . . . work and
    learning.' And the philosophy redraws the boundaries of the classroom
    through a collaborative, emergent, and widely public approach to
    composing."
</p>
<p>
    10:37 A student reflection is highlighted: "Yet, in most college classes,
    the writing relationship is constant—one to one, student to professor.
    Writing takes place in the private space of one's computer or notebook,
    unseen by other student writers." The narrator continues: "Works in
    progress are posted. Readers respond. Writers revise. The openness and
    shared sense of composing transforms relationships."
</p>
<p>
    10:47 Another student reflection fills the screen and an excerpt is
    highlighted: "I was very relieved that I could do an abstract reading for
    the screencast though, because I feel like viewers can get more out of the
    atmosphere created by the screencast instead of having the information
    pounded into their heads without their own thought process. Just as our
    individual reading of McCarthy's text is done without Cormac McCarthy to
    dictate an analysis, the readings of the screencasts should be done without
    the creators' words dictating a reading." The narrator continues: "Public
    composing amplifies investment and authenticity. Jackclyn sees her
    screencast as akin to other class texts, calls herself a 'creator'—crossing
    the boundary between consumer and producer of knowledge. Digital composing
    is here layered with authenticity and engagement, collaborative spaces, new
    channels and modes. We're shifting. Austin started us off asking about
    composing. Let's watch some."
</p>
<p>
    11:22 On screen, two video player windows are arranged side by side and
    enlarged to show excerpts from student reflections. Small, rectangular
    callouts highlight phrases and words in each excerpt. The narrator
    continues: "Serendipitous, really, these clips flowing together. Austin and
    Hannah, thinking about feeling and voice. I'm talking about what we did in
    our class. We're listening while reading pictures of audio rolling like
    waves. Our 'idea[s] of composition [have] changed.' It has taken attention,
    time, and help."
</p>
<p>
    11:45 The multiple windows again fill the screen. The video featuring the
    live musical performance ends. The narrator continues: "The sound track has
    stopped, but extensions of the performance are beginning to build. We see
    them pixelated here. They echo."
</p>
<p>
    12:00 On screen, the cursor selects minimize buttons and windows disappear.
    The narrator continues: "In motion they continue having their say. They
    should never stop." The video ends.

    The video includes three subvideos that have been compiled by the author.
These videos (<em>Shifts in Composing</em>,<em>Performing in the Learning Studio</em>, and <em>Open Assignments, Affective Modes, and Creativity</em>) are themselves
    made from screen recordings of student portfolios. The three videos have
    been edited to highlight excerpts from student reflections.
</p>
<p>
    The video also includes three videos that are hosted on YouTube. A live
    performance of the song "River under African Trance" by the band String
    Cheese Incident plays throughout most of the video. A video called "Big
    Trains Rolling" depicts train imagery. A video called "Pottery Wheel
    Demonstration" and a video called "The Valley" provide more visuals.

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left">The assignments in this class . . . would not ask students to promote a
    single thesis, progress through a focused argument, or come to a
    (necessarily) premature conclusion. . . . In this class, students would be
    invited to disrupt their own positions, to contradict themselves, to expose
    all that must be hidden and excluded in the precious name of clarity. <span class="attribution">Diane Davis,
<span class="attribution-title">Breaking up [at] Totality</span> (242-43) </span> </aside>

    When we get used to one way of looking at things, it's hard to see
    alternatives. "As technologies embed themselves in everyday discourse and
    activity," Jody Shipka tells us, "they slip into the background and it
    becomes far too easy to lose sight of the way they shape, whether for good
    or ill, the routine dimensions of our lives" (54). Shipka is summarizing
    the "disappearance effect" discussed by Bertram Bruce and Maureen Hogan,
    the same phenomenon that Cindy and Richard Selfe described in 1994 when
    discussing the invisibility of the desktop metaphor that shapes our
    computing experience. The concern is that, as these technologies slip into
    the background, we lose sight of how they shape our identities and
    behaviors. The good news is that, as Shipka explains, "one way
    taken-for-granted technologies are rendered visible is through breakdowns
    or disruptions" (55). <em>Casting Learning</em> considers what happens when
    we deploy screen composing in the classroom to create these disruptions.
</p>
<p>
    Diane Davis calls for a pedagogy that's transformative, dangerous even.
    "Writing involves risk," she says. This pedagogy would welcome ambiguity
    and be linked with authenticity and emergence. This approach disrupts the
    closure-oriented modes of college, "forcing a writer constantly to double
    back on herself and her 'texts,' to crack them open again to expose her own
    assumptions, to reveal inconsistencies, motivations, contradictions,
    limitations, incantations" (243). Screen composing allows everyone to
    experiment with ambiguity, incantations, and expectations and to double
    back. <em>Casting Learning</em> is an emergent text built through this
    process, a process begun by asking students to create video scholarship.
</p>
<p>
    Reflection is a key mode of this scholarship. Reflection drives
    creativity, both in the projects under development and in the act of
    looking back on them. This distance between project and assessment, a
    layering, drives creative response. In studies of creativity,
    Keith Sawyer notes, "when a person knows he or she will be rewarded for the
    quality of their work, they can't stop thinking about that reward, and they
    find it impossible to get into the flow state where they're doing the task
simply because they like doing it" (53). The videos in    <em>Casting Learning</em> carve out a space between composing and
    reflection by asking students to creatively revisit their own texts. This
    composing is performative, improvisational, happening "in a zone between
    complete predictability and being out of control" (253). The student voices
    describe the results: "I got into the zone. . . . I didn't even notice I'd
    been sitting there for hours."

<aside class="pullquote-right">How are these alternatives invented? One element of the practice is the
    manifesto, amounting to a discourse on method—a rhetoric or poetics—for a
    new genre or mode of production: a program of experimentation. In teaching
    theory heuretically, a seminar tries out some of these vanguard poetics. <span class="attribution">Gregory Ulmer, <span class="attribution-title">Heuretics</span> (xii) </span> </aside>

<p>
    Emergent composing with ambiguity in mediated spaces marks the poetics
    expressed by Gregory Ulmer in his book <em>Heuretics</em>. Here, a
    composition is "an experiment: it is offered not as a proof or assertion of
    truth but as a trial or test" (38). Ulmer cites Julia Kristeva in
    describing "a space that is neither that of propositional knowledge nor
    commonsense opinion. This boundary or frontier (interface) calls for
    invention conducted as a transgression of the rules." We find "passages"
    between systems of meaning that call into question "classic mimesis,
    argumentation, judgment, realism" (176). As familiar sense and
    intelligibility break down, meaning must "be approached indirectly, by
    extended analogies" (67), an approach that "collapses the distinction
    between concrete and abstract" (128) until the "boundary or frontier
    (interface) function of chora on the verge of language is glimpsed through
    artistic, poetic practices" (176).
</p>
<p>
    This
        heuretics traces from Plato to Kristeva to Derrida to Ulmer and beyond
        through discussions of chora. We find a fit between this kind of composing and video scholarship,
    since, Ulmer notes, "chorography promises something more than just an
    alternative to concept formation as a way to organize data into meaningful
    sets. It promises also to engage the users' premises in the process of
    learning, opening a mutually transforming circuit between judgment and
    theory" (202). In this circuit, we find alternative formations coemerging.
    The moments link feeling with judgment and evoke insights and the joy of
    the sublime (143). And they extend behavior to the point where judgments
    "have been rendered ambiguous, uncertain, undecidable" (214). We experience
    these passages and circuits when we perform screen composing together in
    the classroom.
