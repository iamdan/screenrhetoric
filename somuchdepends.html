<p>00:00 Title on screen: Happening Scholarship: A Response to “The Red Wheelbarrow” Daniel Anderson UNC-Chapel Hill iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan. Typing begins on screen: “So much depends / upon // a red wheel / barrow glazed with rain / water // beside the white / chickens.” Video of man speaking appears. A caption appears next to the speaking figure: Geoffrey Sirc, University of Minnesota.” The figure begins speaking: “So, and this is like Longinus, you know, we don’t want to persuade people when we write. What we want to do is blow their head off, and you know I Get that. We want to amaze them, and so that leads Longinus to talking about the rhetorical figures. And those little snippets in those Marilyn Manson . . . . [voice trails off]
</p>
<p>00:26 Narrator speaks: Geoff Sirc loves Longinus. And those short snippets that lead to the sublime. One of my favorites snippets is “The Red Wheelbarrow,” by William Carlos Williams. The poem has been called a Rorschach’s blot for the way it evokes the whole metaphysical project. What is it that depends? Anything. And everything.
</p>
<p>00:53 A cursor is typing on screen: “The opening is based upon a rhetorical trick, a question left hanging. ‘So much” of what?” Narration continues: “The structure of the poem whets our anticipation with the enjambed, so much depends [pause] upon white space. Then the piece pulls back with particulars that border on the banal. It’s driven the critics nuts. Some say, the poem is about labor. Some say, the modern condition. But my favorite: a certain cast of light.
</p>
<p>01:24 The voice of Geoff Sirc is heard off screen: You know the way that I would do a happening classroom, because you know, I mean students come in and immediately it’s a different atmosphere. That’s what you want. You want to just change the atmosphere in the room so that their not breathing the same old college expectations atmosphere. It’s a different climate and, you know, ah, so, so there.
</p>
<p>01:44 Narrator continues: Viewing the poem as about a cast of light and thinking about atmosphere leads us to the theoretical portion of this alternative response. Happening can’t be uncouple from their space and time. They are atmospheric events, like the weather, like compositions.
</p>
<p>02:06 Geoff Sirc begins speaking again and appears on screen: Let’s spend like a day on the sonnet and let’s just marvel at this, you know. Or whatever, because, you know, it’s just . . . language I think is what’s for me happening.
</p>
<p>02:20 Narrator continues: So now we’ve linked composing with the weather. We just need to add chickens. Let’s start with a scene outside of a window.
</p>
<p>02:30 On screen an image of a laptop screen appears, and then the scene pans up to show a view outside of a window. Narration continues: This is looking out from my house on the front yard. And now let’s add some trickery. This is my laptop set up to record a performance of some music. And a projector set up to cast images of moving hands upon the surface of a guitar as the music plays.
</p>
<p>02:52 On screen, images showing a projector, a guitar, and a video of moving hands appear: Narration continues: Now let’s add a video of those moving hands. And let’s add some moving wheat with a certain cast of light. Let’s gather ourselves. Let’s breathe in deeply. And breathe out together. Let’s see what happens.
</p>
<p>03:21 On screen images of moving hands, a guitar, a scene outside of a window, and wheat are shuffled on screen. A hand appears in the image of the guitar and begins filming with a mobile phone. The hand begins strumming the guitar and music plays.
</p>
<p>03:40 The narrator begins singing: I walk in the rain from time to time. I feel the drops upon my face and see them as they glisten in the light, so bright, on the wheelbarrow.
</p>
<p>04:12 On screen the narrator appears opaque beneath images of wheat, hands, and a guitar. The narrator continues singing: The smell of sweet gardenia in the air. There’s a scratching in the dirt nearby and you wonder why. And you turn to hear. And your eye is clear. As the birds appear.
</p>
<p>04:45 On screen a video appears showing a passage in a book being underlined in pencil. The underlined phrase reads: One of the subtexts of Composition as a Happening is the realization that art criticism in general offers more compelling theory than Composition’s canon, particularly (in this case) in relation to the sublime.
</p>
<p>04:53 Narrator continues singing: I will walk beside you till the end. And we will just grow closer with each tender hour we spend, looking out upon the garden as it reaches toward the rainshower, like a friend. Cause on you and I together and the chickens and the weather, so much depends.
</p>
<p>05:33 A sound snippet from a documentary film can be heard in the background: weather, on the other hand, refers to the day-to-day conditions of the earth’s atmosphere. Narrator continues singing: I whisper your name from time to time. I smell the drops the upon your hair and I take your hand in mine. And I hold you tight. I find your smile. And we both sigh.
</p>
<p>06:08 The sound of a chicken softly cooing can be heard. Images of wheat, a laptop, hands, and a guitar shift on screen A cursor typing text moves up and down the screen: English Composition as a Happening is student text as Blue Balloon. Where is the space for spiritual intensification in Mainstream Composition’s curriculum? The narrator continues singing: And the clouds open like islands in the sky. And the birds are scratching here nearby and a silver light it shines, on the colors in your eyes, and the water-covered sides of the wheelbarrow.
</p>
<p>06:40 Narrator continues singing: I will walk beside you till the end. And we will just grow closer with each tender hour we spend, looking out upon the garden as it reaches toward the sunlight, like a friend. Cause on you and I together and the chickens and the weather, so much depends.
</p>
<p>07:22 A cursor appears and screen and deletes the words, Works Cited, the begins typing materials. The text on screen begins to scroll through a list of citations. The narrator continues singing: On you and I together, on you and I together. On you and I together, on you and I together
</p>
<p>07:45. The guitar stops playing. The narrator sings: So much depends. The images on screen fade out to show the desktop of a computer. Across the desktop is written: This machine performs critique with compassion. A cursor moves to the top of the screen and opens a dropdown menu. The cursor selects and item from the menu that reads Stop Recording. Video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

The bulk of materials are videos and sounds gathered from the internet. Key
background visuals are taken from the video, SUNLIGHt, by Nicholas Bro. This
piece depicts the moving wheat that is layered into the captured screen
performance. This visuals are key to created the sense of ambience and sunlight
that the closing verses of the response call for. The imagery has an added
element of resonance in that it occassionally depicts a moving hand that links
with the motif in the video. The video, Self Massage, by Homespa Beauty plays a
similar role. The piece evokes the sense of human companionship identified in
the video response to the poem in the way it displays two hands gripping and
rubbing each other. The contrast of the bright hands against a dark backround
enables the clip to be layered among the other elements demonstrating the moving
hands motif.</p>

<p>Other elements taken from the internet create the visual and sonic ambience
in the piece. These include the video, Rain Turning Sunny Time-lapse, by
MegaMysticalGamer, and snippets from a documentary and several audio clips with
sounds of nature or weather. </p>

<p>The text of the poem, "The Red Wheelbarrow" is included as part of the
academic discussion of the work. As with print essays discussing the poem for
scholarly and educatiobnal purposes, the video response reproduces the work. In
this piece the use is transfromational as both audio snippets and performed
composing of the poem are woven into the fabric of the response.</p>

<p>The remaining materials also are used in typical academic ways. Excerpts from
scholarly articles or personal interviews are woven into the discussion to
illuminate the text and support conclusions.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<p>This video was performed at the 2017 Computers and Writing Conference. An
earlier version was presented at the Modern Language Association Convention in
2016. The heart of the piece is a song writtent to re-interpret the poem, "The
Red Wheelbarrow," by William Carlos Williams. The video also suggests that remix
(rather than analysis) can productively respond to the "suspicous" nature of
most academic work. So Much Depends points toward the limits of academic
critique, and then offers a nonsuspicious reading of Wiliams's poem. </P>

  <aside class="pullquote-left">Official composition has persisted as a bland,
  sanitized pedagogy, teaching clear, correct, citation-based essay form to
  students, using a literarily thin corpus of nonfiction readings as prompts.
  This is so limited, it’s unbearable. If you want to find the stuff in the field
  that really glitters, you’ve got to root through the discard heap. -- Geoff Sirc</aside>

<p>In terms of screen composing, the video evokes Williams's edict, "no ideas
but in things." Here, the sense of words as vehicles for ideas is translated
into the imagery of hands. The images, as Giles Deleuze explains "constitute a
malleable mass, a descriptive material loaded with visual and sound features of
expression" (154). The poem also enacts the ways that compositions co-emerge with
their contexts. An atmospheric sense of weather points toward the ambiguous
circumstances that situate creative expression. In his book on ambience, Thomas
Rickert highlights the limits of many of our models of invention, noting that
"affect, habituation, sensation, intutition, environment, and accident, to list
a few elements, are equally part of the genesis of ideas" (60).</p>

<p>The narration in the video references "particulars that border on the banal."
In many moments in the video, the screen is opaque and contains an e-mail
message that reads: “I love the red on the new cover design.” Beneath the
message is e-mail header information: ----- Original Message ----- / From
“Hochman Will” <hochmanw1@GMAIL.COM> / To: WPA-L@ASU.EDU / Sent: Friday,
February 27, 2025 4:48:17 PM / Subject: New CCC.”

Geoff Sirc suggests that "our composition must change materially" (115) and that
material changes can represent "heretofore unseen" (115) realities. Disruptive
changes provide missing vectors that challenge "predictability" of traditional
academic modes, that reinvigorate "composition as a material gesture" (113). The
reference to the color red emerged as part of an online discussion of an
editorial change for the major academic journal in the field of composition
studies. The journal's change in direction captured with a small reference to
its cover design, an e-mail message shared on a discussion list by Will Hochman.
The screen shot of the message offers a material gesture through the banal
particular that evokes the larger dynamics of the field of composition
studies.</p>[add image of e-mail]



<p> At around 02:20, the video transitions to a scene
outside of a window. The scene, however, is layered among several captures that
create a performance that might be called ambient. Key among these is the use of
a projector to display moving hands across the surface of a guitar. That
surface, however, is filmed by the "webcam" and subsequently captured on the
surface of laptop screen. The move extends what is already an ambient mode of
writing: screen capturing turns the surface of the "desktop" into a composing
space. The camera filming outward
captures what's in front of the screen. The surfaces accrue until the
performances and their capturings are more passages among layers than separable
artifacts or events.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Rhetoric has a material dimension, and it is an
embodied and embedded practice. Rhetoric is an emergent result of
environmentally situated and interactive engagements, redolent of a world that
affects us, that persuades us prior to symbolicity -- Ambient Rhetoric (34)
</aside>

<p>When the piece was presented at the conference, a cell phone camera was
turned on to record the performance. The camera captures the narrator speaking
and singing in the lecture hall. At moments during the second half of the video,
two vocal tracks with the narrator singing can be heard. After the conference,
the narration and singing was recorded using a vocal microphone. The final
compilation brings together the cell phone footage, the  video presented at the
conference, and a final audio track. At select moments, the opacities and sound
levels are adjusted to bring to the surface the conference presentation. The
video track that was played at the conference also includes numerous background
sounds--thunder, nature, chickens. Reading these many visual and sonic layers as
scholarly claims calls for attention to what Rickert describes as an
"environment [that] becomes a weave of musical, semantic, and visual
communication flows" (138). The challenge is mixing these flows with familiar
forms of sharing and representing knowledge.</p>

<p>In screen composing, we extend familiar modes of moving information and work
with "sounds and sights [that] immerse us in a multisensory, spatial
environment, one pulsing with strong affective and suasive forces" (138).
Rickert notes that these modes "extend beyond our immediate cognitive focus" and
that "nonsemantic" elements like "emotional modulations" make it difficult to
account for composing with sounds and visuals using traditional information
schemes. In discussing ambience, Rickert suggests, "music becomes its own
affective ground" (29) as it evokes emergent experiences where "various feedback
loops arise--sonic, affective, haptic, performative--and transform the music at
every moment" (29). As music emerges, composing or reading among these loops
becomes an immersive experience, one that unfolds together with "the ambient
environs in which it emerges" (139).</p>


<p>And these loops need not be limited to sonic mixings. In describing the
paintings of Emily Kngwarreye, Erin Manning notes a similar "rhythm of the land"
(181) that includes "the weather, the seasons, the births and deaths, the
rituals and performances" (181). Like Rickert, Manning evokes affect in
discussing immersive experience, noting that "we must feel these occasions of
experience in their eventness" (64). The experience is co-emergent and links
composer to environment as "there is no inside/outside to the sensations: they
are as much of the body as of the land, extending synesthetically beyond all
comprehension of three-dimensional space-time" (181). For screen composers,
Manning invites a focus on the "capacity to create experiential space-times"
rather than familiar notions of "content" (64). Like the banal
particularity of a wheelbarrow as the weather shifts from clouds to sun,
"transformation entails a shift in affective tone such that the participating
specator feels the performance" (64).
