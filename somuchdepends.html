    This video was performed at the 2017 Computers and Writing Conference. An
    earlier version was presented at the Modern Language Association Convention
    in 2016. Although the piece contains traditional academic sources delivered
    through textual excerpts and spoken words, a good deal of sonic and visual
    materials add creative layers. The video also includes a song written to
    interpret the poem "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos Williams, which
    plays in the second half of the piece.
</p>
<p>
    The video contains footage from an online interview with Geoff Sirc,
    presented as thumbnail-sized, talking head segments. A number of quotations
    are also integrated into the video, either as images or as live typing. The
    video also includes mobile phone footage that captures the author
    presenting the piece. And the composition includes a recording of a
    projector casting imagery on a guitar, as well as other video layers that
    capture the recording setting.

<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>
    00:00 Title on screen: "Happening Scholarship: A Response to 'The Red
    Wheelbarrow' Daniel Anderson UNC-Chapel Hill iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan." The
    faint image of Anderson hunched over a laptop appears on screen, then
    fades. Typing begins: "So much depends / upon // a red wheel / barrow //
    glazed with rain / water // beside the white / chickens." The text appears,
    gradually, in a column in the middle of the screen, overlaid on a partially
    legible quote about teaching. A video of a man speaking appears
    simultaneously in the bottom left corner, accompanied by a caption:
    "Geoffrey Sirc, University of Minnesota." The figure begins speaking: "So,
    and this is like Longinus, you know, we don't want to persuade people when
    we write. What we want to do is blow their head off, and you know I get
    that: we want to amaze them. And so that leads Longinus to talking about
    the rhetorical figures. And those little snippets in those Marilyn Manson .
    . ." Sirc's voice trails off.
</p>
<p>
    00:26 The poem scrolls in opaque font along the right of the screen, bits
    of criticism or speculation appear in browser windows, and an opaque video
    of Anderson delivering the narration is visible. The narrator begins to
    speak: "Geoff Sirc loves Longinus—and those short snippets that lead to the
    sublime. One of my favorites snippets is 'The Red Wheelbarrow,' by William
    Carlos Williams. The poem has been called a Rorschach's blot for the way it
    evokes the whole metaphysical project. What is it that depends? Anything.
    And everything."
</p>
<p>
    00:53 A cursor is typing on screen: "The opening is based upon a rhetorical
    trick, a question left hanging. 'So much of what?'" An email is briefly
    visible, as is Anderson in a small video window in the bottom left. As web
    browsers and an image of an acoustic guitar, pictured on a laptop, appear
    on screen, the narration continues: "The structure of the poem whets our
    anticipation with the enjambed, 'so much depends'—pause—'upon,' white
    space. Then the piece pulls back with particulars that border on the banal.
    It's driven the critics nuts. Some say the poem is about labor. Some say,
    the modern condition. But my favorite: 'a certain cast of light.'"
</p>
<p>
    01:24 The voice of Geoff Sirc is heard, his face slightly visible in the
    top right. On screen, raindrops fall and condense in small puddles, layered
    on text and images of grass. Sirc says: "You know the way that I would do,
    you know, a happening classroom, because you know, I mean students come in
    and immediately it's a different atmosphere. That's what you want. You want
    to just change the atmosphere in the room so that they're not breathing the
    same old college-expectation atmosphere. It's a different climate and, you
    know, ah, so, so there."
</p>
<p>
    01:44 A video of the author delivering a presentation is visible on the
    right, along with a screenshot of an email message and an excerpt from an
    article that reads: "Official composition has persisted as a bland,
    sanitized pedagogy, teaching clear, correct, citation-based essay form to
    students, using a literarily thin corpus of nonfiction readings as prompts.
    This is so limited, it's unbearable. If you want to find the stuff in the
    field that really glitters, you've got to root through the discard heap.
    Your history has to be alternative or, as Byron Hawk calls his, 'counter.'"
    The author's voice is occasionally doubled, overlapped with another version
    of the same narration: "Viewing the poem as about a 'cast of light' and
    thinking about atmosphere leads us to the theoretical portion of this
    alternative response. Happenings can't be uncoupled from their space and
    time. They are atmospheric events, like the weather, like compositions."
</p>
<p>
    02:06 Geoff Sirc begins speaking again and appears on screen. The video of
    Anderson lecturing is still visible on the right of the screen, his voice
    at times layered with Sirc's: "Let's spend like a day on the sonnet and
    let's just marvel at this, you know. Or whatever, because, you know, it's
    just . . . language I think is what's, is what's for me happening."
</p>
<p>
    02:20 A block of text commenting on the discipline of "composition" or
    "first year writing" appears on screen. The narrator continues: "So now
    we've linked composing with the weather. We just need to add chickens.
    Let's start with a scene outside of a window."
</p>
<p>
    02:30 An image of a laptop screen appears, and then the scene pans up to
    show a view of grass and trees outside of a window. The narrator continues:
    "This is looking out from my house on the front yard. And now let's add
    some trickery. This is my laptop set up to record a performance of some
    music. And a projector set up to cast images of moving hands upon the
    surface of a guitar as the music plays."
</p>
<p>
    02:52 On screen, windows show a projector, a red guitar, wheat, and a video
    of moving hands. The narrator continues: "Now let's add a video of those
    moving hands. And let's add some moving wheat with a certain cast of light.
    Let's gather ourselves. Let's breathe in deeply. And breathe out together.
    Let's see what happens."
</p>
<p>
    03:21 On screen, images of moving hands, a guitar, a scene outside of a
    window, and wheat are shuffled. A hand appears in the image of the guitar
    and places a mobile phone in front of the guitar, filming outward. The hand
    begins strumming the guitar and music plays.
</p>
<p>
    03:40 The narrator begins singing: "I walk in the rain from time to time /
    I feel the drops upon my face / and see them as they glisten / in the
    light, / so bright, / on the wheelbarrow."
</p>
<p>
    04:12 On screen, the narrator appears, singing, arms open, opaque beneath
    images of wheat, hands, the guitar, the laptop, and excerpts of scholarly
    writing. The narrator continues singing: "The smell of sweet gardenia in
    the air. / There's a scratching in the dirt nearby / and you wonder why. /
    And you turn to hear / and your eye is clear / as the birds appear."
</p>
<p>
    04:45 A video appears in the bottom of the screen, showing a pencil
    underlining a passage in a book: "One of the subtexts of Composition as a
    Happening is the realization that art criticism in general offers more
    compelling theory than Composition's canon, particularly (in this case) in
    relation to the sublime."
</p>
<p>
    04:53 Images and videos continue to overlap. The phrase "this machine
    performs critique with compassion" is legible on the desktop of the laptop.
    Scholarly text appears in the foreground and is variously highlighted. The
    narrator continues singing: "I will walk beside you ‘til the end. / And we
    will just grow closer / with each tender hour we spend, / looking out upon
    the garden as it reaches toward the rain shower, / like a friend. / 'Cause
    on you and I together / and the chickens and the weather, / so much
    depends."
</p>
<p>
    05:33 A sound snippet from a documentary film can be heard in the
    background: "weather, on the other hand, refers to the day-to-day
    conditions of the Earth's atmosphere." The video of bright white hands
    appears in the center of the screen. The narrator continues singing: "I
    whisper your name from time to time. / I smell the drops upon your hair /
    and I take your hand in mine. / And I hold you tight. / I find your smile.
    / And we both sigh."
</p>
<p>
    06:08 The sound of a chicken softly cooing can be heard. Images of wheat, a
    laptop, hands, and a guitar shift on screen. A cursor typing text moves up
    and down the screen: "English Composition as a Happening is Student Text as
    Blue Balloon. Where is the space for spiritual intensification in
    Mainstream Composition's curriculum?" (280). The narrator continues
    singing, his voice doubled: "And the clouds open like islands in the sky. /
    And the birds are scratching here nearby / and a silver light it shines, /
    on the colors in your eyes, / and the water-covered sides / of the
    wheelbarrow."
</p>
<p>
    06:40 Text is revealed along the bottom of the screen: "Even in the most
    radically challenging Modernist art, there is an aesthetic, a sense of
    formal interest, a shimmering sheen." The narrator continues singing,
    visible beneath layers of guitar, wheat, text: "I will walk beside you ‘til
    the end. / And we will just grow closer / with each tender hour we spend, /
    looking out upon the garden as it reaches toward the sunlight, / like a
    friend. / 'Cause on you and I together / and the chickens and the weather,
    / so much depends."
</p>
<p>
    07:22 A cursor appears on screen in a text document and deletes the words,
    Works Cited. The text on screen begins to scroll through a list of
    citations. The narrator continues singing: "On you and I together, / on you
    and I together, / on you and I together, / on you and I together."
</p>
<p>
    07:45. The guitar stops playing. The narrator sings, arms outstretched: "So
    much depends." The images on screen fade out to show the desktop of a
    computer. Across the desktop is written: "This machine performs critique
    with compassion." A cursor moves to the top of the screen and opens a
    dropdown menu. The cursor selects an item from the menu that reads "Stop
    Recording." The video stops.

    The bulk of materials are videos and sounds gathered from the internet. The
    videos "SUNLIGHT" and "Self Massage" offer motifs of wheat and hands. Other
    items contribute to the visual and sonic ambience in the piece. These
    include time-lapse footage of weather, snippets from a documentary, and
    several audio clips with sounds of nature or weather.
</p>
<p>
    The text of "The Red Wheelbarrow" appears in the video. In this project,
    the analysis reproduces the work it discusses. In the video, audio snippets
    and performed composing of the poem are remixed into the response. The
    remaining materials are used in typical academic ways. Excerpts from
    scholarly articles or personal interviews are woven into the discussion to
    illuminate the text and support conclusions.

<p>
    William Carlos Williams's edict "no ideas but in things" makes a perfect
    credo for using images in screen composing. Just as word-things become
    vehicles for ideas, image-things carry forward their messages. Of course,
    we engage these visual materials differently. Images, Gilles Deleuze
    explains, "constitute a malleable mass, a descriptive material loaded with
    visual and sound features of expression" (154). <em>So Much Depends</em>
    complicates this rich delivery by blurring visuals with their contexts and
    with sounds. Images projected on instruments, cameras filming outward from
    the composer, and scenes outside a window point toward the circumstances
    that situate creative expression. Thomas Rickert offers "ambience" to note
    how "affect, habituation, sensation, intuition, environment, and accident,
    to list a few elements, are equally part of the genesis of ideas" (60).
    Composed in part while looking out a window responding to a poem about
    looking, the video uses images to share a sense of atmospheres.
</p>

alt="Screenshot of an e-mail message"> <figcaption> <p>A screen shot with an e-mail message from Will Hochman is layered into the composition</p>
</figcaption> </figure>


<p>
    At several moments in the video, the screen is opaque and contains an email
    message that reads: "I love the red on the new cover design." Beneath the
    message is email header information: "----- Original Message ----- / From
    'Hochman Will' / To: WPA-L@ASU.EDU / Sent: Friday, February 27, 2015
    4:48:17 PM / Subject: New CCC." Geoff Sirc suggests that "our composition
    must change materially" (<em>English Composition</em>,<em> </em>115) and
    that material changes can represent "heretofore unseen" (115) realities.
    Disruptive changes provide missing vectors that challenge the
    "predictability" of traditional academic modes, that reinvigorate
    "composition as a material gesture" (113). The reference to the color red
    emerged as part of an online discussion of an editorial change for the
    major academic journal in the field of composition studies. The sender of
    the message, Will Hochman, was well aware of debates about creativity,
    disciplinary divides, and screen writing. Hochman was a poet who also
    studied and taught digital composition. The email message offers a small
    celebration of a change in cover design. The screen shot of the message
    offers a material gesture through the banal particular that opens meaning
    and evokes the larger dynamics of a surrounding field.
</p>
<p>
    Divisions between literature and composition have played out for decades.
    Some tension traces to misperceptions that align aesthetics and creativity
    with literature, while casting composition as utilitarian. There is some
    truth to the characterizations; professional aspects of language are
    featured in composition studies while aesthetics mark the teaching of
    literature. At the same time, beautiful language matters to writing
    teachers and professional pathways open all the time in literature
    classrooms. Still, divisions remain. In 2012, Sirc warned composition
    scholars not to forget "the power of literary art to affect lives and
    effect change" (511). He also celebrated "dazzling occasions for writing"
    (514) that include music, pop culture, lists, manifestos, and other
possibilities that might "[slip] through the cracks" (513). In    <em>So Much Depends</em>, Sirc speaks about these occasions. Teaching
    writing becomes less about choosing between utility and aesthetics and more
    about creating a productive space for composing: "You want to just change
    the atmosphere in the room so that they're not breathing the same old
    college-expectation atmosphere. It's a different climate."
</p>
<p>
    At around 02:20, the video transitions to a scene outside a window. The
    scene is layered among several videos that bring together images and
    surfaces. A projector displays moving hands across the surface of a guitar.
    That surface is filmed by the laptop camera. The scene is also filmed from
    the perspective of the guitar using a mobile phone. A screen recorder also
    captures the visual surface of the laptop. As software creates and records
    these many scenes, the screen becomes an ambient space for atmospheric
    mixing. The images and surfaces accrue until the performances and their
    capturings are more like passages among layers than separable artifacts or
    events.

</aside>

<p>
    When <em>So Much Depends</em> was presented, a mobile phone was used to
    record the author-narrator speaking and singing in the lecture hall. At
    moments during the second half of the video, two vocal tracks can be heard.
    After the conference, the narration and singing were recorded again. The
    compilation brings together the phone footage from the conference, the
    video presented at the conference, and this final audio track. At select
    moments, the opacities and sound levels are adjusted to vary intensities
    and bring to the surface different elements. The video track that was
    played at the conference also includes background sounds—thunder, nature,
    chickens. These interpretive scenes are cast from "The Red Wheelbarrow."
    The visual and sonic layers emerge from what Rickert describes as an
    "environment [that] becomes a weave of musical, semantic, and visual
    communication flows" (138). The challenge is making sense of these flows as
    similar (or alternatives) to familiar ways of engaging a beautiful text.
</p>
<p>
    Through the screen, we bring together "sounds and sights [that] immerse us
    in a multisensory, spatial environment, one pulsing with strong affective
    and suasive forces" (138). Rickert notes how these modes move "beyond our
    immediate cognitive focus" with "nonsemantic" elements that register as
    "emotional modulations." Sound, motion, and image extend traditional
    information schemes with interpretations emerging through loops and layers.
    Most readings of poems use prose to review what's been said by others,
    before offering an interpretation. The formula provides a frame for the
    scholarship. <em>So Much Depends</em> takes a similar approach. After
    spending time with what others have said, close reading the poem, and
    sorting through ideas, we craft a response. In this instance, a song
    blended with video.
</p>
<p>
    Language, Julia Kristeva tells us, is one component among many in a
    semiotic network: "With a material support such as the voice, this semiotic
    network gives 'music' to literature" (113). Music reworks logic and
    ideologies as it displaces meaning into the semiotic realms of sound. The
    second half of the video tests the proposition that "musicality is not
    without signification; indeed it is deployed within it" (114). For Rickert
    as well, these components shift possibilities for making meaning, since
    "music becomes its own affective ground" (29) as it evokes emergent
    experiences where "various feedback loops arise—sonic, affective, haptic,
    performative—and transform the music at every moment" (29). Composing or
    reading among these loops becomes an immersive experience, one that unfolds
    together with "the ambient environs in which it emerges" (139).
</p>
<p>
    And these loops need not be limited to sonic mixings. Describing the
    paintings of Emily Kngwarreye, Erin Manning notes a similar "rhythm of the
    land" (181) that includes "the weather, the seasons, the births and deaths,
    the rituals and performances" (181). Manning says that shifts in affective
tone make us "feel these occasions of experience in their eventness" (64). The experience is coemergent
    and links composer to environment, since "there is no inside/outside to the
    sensations: they are as much of the body as of the land, extending
    synesthetically beyond all comprehension of three-dimensional space-time"
    (181). Video scholarship can draw from Manning's focus on the "capacity to
    create experiential space-times" rather than familiar notions of "content"
    (64). <em>So Much Depends</em> offers a space-time experience
