<div class="panel">

<p>This video contains a several media items that have been combined into an
academic presentation. Footage from an online interview with Geoff Sirc is woven
throughout the piece. A number of quotations are also integrated into the video.
The video also includes a recording of a song that has been filmed as a
projector casts imagery on a guitar. And cell phone footage that captures the
author delivering a presentation and singing the song is included in the
video.</p>


<p>00:00 Title on screen: “Happening Scholarship: A Response to ‘The Red Wheelbarrow’ Daniel Anderson UNC-Chapel Hill iamdan@unc.edu @iamdan.” The faint image of Anderson hunched over a laptop appears on screen, then fades. Typing begins: “So much depends / upon // a red wheel / barrow // glazed with rain / water // beside the white / chickens.” The text appears, gradually, in a column in the middle of the screen, overlaid on a partially-legible quote about pedagogy. A video of a man speaking appears simultaneously in the bottom left corner, accompanied by a caption: “Geoffrey Sirc, University of Minnesota.” The figure begins speaking: “So, and this is like Longinus, you know, we don’t want to persuade people when we write. What we want to do is blow their head off, and you know I get that: we want to amaze them. And so that leads Longinus to talking about the rhetorical figures. And those little snippets in those Marilyn Manson . . ."Sirc’s voice trails off.
</p>

<p>00:26 The poem scrolls in opaque font along the right of the screen, bits of
criticism or speculation appear in browser windows, and an opaque video of
Anderson delivering the narration is visible. The narrator begins to speak: “Geoff Sirc loves Longinus--and
those short snippets that lead to the sublime. One of my favorites snippets is
‘The Red Wheelbarrow,’ by William Carlos Williams. The poem has been called a
Rorschach’s blot for the way it evokes the whole metaphysical project. What is
it that depends? Anything. And everything.”

</p> <p>00:53 A cursor is typing on screen: “The opening is based upon a
rhetorical trick, a question left hanging. ‘So much of what?” An email is
briefly visible, as is Anderson in a small video window in the bottom
left. As web browsers and an image of an acoustic guitar,
pictured on a laptop, appear on screen, the narration continues: “The structure of the poem whets our
anticipation with the enjambed, ‘so much depends’--pause--‘upon, white space.’
Then the piece pulls back with particulars that border on the banal. It’s driven
the critics nuts. Some say the poem is about labor. Some say, the modern
condition. But my favorite: ‘a certain cast of light.’” </p>

<p>01:24 The voice of Geoff Sirc is heard, his face slightly visible in the top
right corner. On screen, raindrops fall and condense in small puddles, layered on text and
images of grass. Sirc says: “You know the way that I would do, you know, a
happening classroom, because you know, I mean students come in and immediately
it’s a different atmosphere. That’s what you want. You want to just change the
atmosphere in the room so that they’re not breathing the same old
college-expectation atmosphere. It’s a different climate and, you know, ah, so,
so there.” </p>

<p>01:44 A video of the author delivering a presentation is visible on the right, along with a screenshot of
an email and windows containing rhetorical scholarship. The author's voice is
occasionally doubled, overlapped with another version of the same narration: “Viewing the poem as about a
‘cast of light’ and thinking about atmosphere leads us to the theoretical
portion of this alternative response. Happenings can’t be uncoupled from their
space and time. They are atmospheric events, like the weather, like
compositions.” </p>

<p>02:06 Geoff Sirc begins speaking again and appears on screen. The video of
Anderson lecturing is still visible on the right of the screen, his voice at
times layered with Sirc’s: “Let’s spend like a day on the sonnet and let’s just
marvel at this, you know. Or whatever, because, you know, it’s just . . .
language I think is what’s, is what’s for me happening.” </p>

<p>02:20 A block of text commenting on the discipline of “composition” or “first year writing” appears on screen. The narrator continues: “So now we’ve linked composing with the weather. We just need to add chickens. Let’s start with a scene outside of a window.”
</p>

<p>02:30 On screen, an image of a laptop screen appears, and then the scene pans up to show a view of grass and trees outside of a window. The narrator  continues: “This is looking out from my house on the front yard. And now let’s add some trickery. This is my laptop set up to record a performance of some music. And a projector set up to cast images of moving hands upon the surface of a guitar as the music plays.”
</p>

<p>02:52 On screen, images showing a projector, a red guitar, and a video of moving hands appear. The narration continues: “Now let’s add a video of those moving hands. And let’s add some moving wheat with a certain cast of light. Let’s gather ourselves. Let’s breathe in deeply. And breathe out together. Let’s see what happens.”
</p>

<p>03:21 On screen, images of moving hands, a guitar, a scene outside of a
window, and wheat are shuffled. A hand appears in the image of the
guitar and places a mobile phone in front of the guitar, filming outward. The hand begins strumming the
guitar and music plays. </p>

<p>03:40 The narrator begins singing: “I walk in the rain from time to time / I
feel the drops upon my face / and see them as they glisten / in the light, / so
bright, on the wheelbarrow.” </p>

<p>04:12 On screen, the narrator appears, singing, arms open, opaque beneath
images of wheat, hands, the guitar, the laptop, and excerpts of scholarly
writing. The narrator continues singing: “The smell of sweet gardenia in the
air. / There’s a scratching in the dirt nearby and you wonder why / And you turn
to hear / And your eye is clear / As the birds appear.” </p>

<p>04:45 A video appears in the bottom of the screen, showing a passage in a book being underlined in pencil: “One of the subtexts of Composition as a Happening is the realization that art criticism in general offers more compelling theory than Composition’s canon, particularly (in this case) in relation to the sublime.”
</p>

<p>04:53 Images and videos continue to overlap. The phrase, “this machine
performs critique with compassion” is legible on the desktop of the laptop. Scholarly text appears in the
foreground and is variously highlighted. The narrator continues singing: “I will
walk beside you till the end. / And we will just grow closer / with each tender
hour we spend, / looking out upon the garden as it reaches toward the
rainshower, / like a friend. / Cause on you and I together / and the chickens and
the weather, / so much depends.” </p>

<p>05:33 A sound snippet from a documentary film can be heard in the background:
“weather, on the other hand, refers to the day-to-day conditions of the earth’s
atmosphere.” The video of bright white hands appears in the center of the
screen. The narrator continues singing: “I whisper your name from time to time. / I
smell the drops the upon your hair / and I take your hand in mine. / And I hold
you tight. / I find your smile. / And we both sigh.” </p>

<p>06:08 The sound of a chicken softly cooing can be heard. Images of wheat, a
laptop, hands, and a guitar shift on screen. A cursor typing text moves up and
down the screen: “English Composition as a Happening is Student Text as Blue
Balloon. Where is the space for spiritual intensification in Mainstream
Composition’s curriculum?” (280). The narrator continues singing, his voice
doubled: “And the clouds open like islands in the sky. / And the birds are
scratching here nearby / and a silver light it shines, / on the colors in your
eyes, / and the water-covered sides / of the wheelbarrow.” </p>

<p>06:40 Text is revealed along the bottom of the screen: “Even in the most radically challenging Modernist art, there is an aesthetic, a sense of formal interest, a shimmering sheen.” The narrator continues singing, visible beneath layers of guitar, wheat, text: “I will walk beside you till the end. / And we will just grow closer with each tender hour we spend, / looking out upon the garden as it reaches toward the sunlight, / like a friend. / Cause on you and I together and the chickens and the weather, / so much depends.”
</p>

<p>07:22 A cursor appears on screen in a text document and deletes the words, Works Cited. The
text on screen begins to scroll through a list of citations. The narrator
continues singing: “On you and I together, / on you and I together. / On you and
I together, / on you and I together.” </p>

<p>07:45. The guitar stops playing. The narrator sings, arms outstretched: “So
much depends.” The images on screen fade out to show the desktop of a computer.
Across the desktop is written: “This machine performs critique with compassion.”
A cursor moves to the top of the screen and opens a dropdown menu. The cursor
selects an item from the menu that reads “Stop Recording.” The video stops. </p>



</div>

<button class="accordion">Materials and Sources</button> <div
class="panel"> The bulk of materials are videos and sounds gathered from the
internet. "SUNLIGHT" and "Self
Massage" create motifs of wheat and hands." Other items create the visual and sonic ambience
  in the piece. These include time-lapse footage of weather, snippets from a documentary, and several audio clips with
  sounds of nature or weather. </p>

  <p>The text of the poem, "The Red Wheelbarrow," is included as part of the
  academic discussion of the work. As with print essays discussing the poem for
  scholarly and educatiobnal purposes, the video response reproduces the work.
  In this piece, the use is transfromational as both audio snippets and performed
  composing of the poem are woven into the fabric of the response. The remaining
  materials are used in typical academic ways. Excerpts from scholarly
  articles or personal interviews are woven into the discussion to illuminate
  the text and support conclusions.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<p>This video was performed at the 2017 Computers and Writing Conference. An
earlier version was presented at the Modern Language Association Convention in
2016. The heart of the piece is a song written to re-interpret the poem, "The
Red Wheelbarrow," by William Carlos Williams. The video also suggests that remix
(rather than analysis) can offer an affirmative alternative to the "suspicious" nature of
most academic work. <em>So Much Depends</em> points toward the limits of academic
critique, and then offers a nonsuspicious reading of Wiliams's poem. </P>

  <aside class="pullquote-left">Official composition has persisted as a bland,
  sanitized pedagogy, teaching clear, correct, citation-based essay form to
  students, using a literarily thin corpus of nonfiction readings as prompts.
  This is so limited, it’s unbearable. If you want to find the stuff in the field
  that really glitters, you’ve got to root through the discard heap. <span class="attribution"> Geoff Sirc, “Resisting Entropy" (511)</span></aside>

<p>In terms of screen composing, the video evokes Williams's edict, "no ideas
but in things." Here, the sense of word-things as vehicles for ideas is translated
into the imagery of hands. Images, as Gilles Deleuze explains, "constitute a
malleable mass, a descriptive material loaded with visual and sound features of
expression" (154). The poem also enacts the ways that compositions co-emerge with
their contexts. An atmospheric sense of weather points toward the ambiguous
circumstances that situate creative expression. In his book on ambience, Thomas
Rickert highlights the limits of many of our models of invention, noting that
"affect, habituation, sensation, intuition, environment, and accident, to list
a few elements, are equally part of the genesis of ideas" (60).</p>

</figcaption> </figure>


<p>At several moments in the video, the screen is opaque and contains an e-mail
message that reads: “I love the red on the new cover design.” Beneath the
message is e-mail header information: ----- Original Message ----- / From
“Hochman Will” <hochmanw1@GMAIL.COM> / To: WPA-L@ASU.EDU / Sent: Friday,
February 27, 2015 4:48:17 PM / Subject: New CCC.”

Geoff Sirc suggests that "our composition must change materially" (115) and that
material changes can represent "heretofore unseen" (115) realities. Disruptive
changes provide missing vectors that challenge the "predictability" of traditional
academic modes, that reinvigorate "composition as a material gesture" (113). The
reference to the color red emerged as part of an online discussion of an
editorial change for the major academic journal in the field of composition
studies.
The screen shot of the message offers a material gesture through the banal
particular that evokes the larger dynamics of the field of composition
studies in February of 2015.</p>





<p> At around 02:20, the video transitions to a scene outside of a window. The
scene, however, is layered among several captures that create a performance that
is an amalgalm of multiple images on multiple surfaces. Among these is the use
of a projector to display moving hands across the surface of a guitar. That
surface, however, is filmed by the laptop camera and subsequently captured on
the surface of laptop screen. (As well as filmed from the perspective of the
guitar with a mobile phone. The move extends what is already an ambient mode of
writing: screen capturing turns the surface of the "desktop" into a composing
space. The laptop camera filming outward captures what's in front of the screen. The
surfaces accrue until the performances and their capturings are more passages
among layers than separable artifacts or events.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Rhetoric has a material dimension, and it is an
embodied and embedded practice. Rhetoric is an emergent result of
environmentally situated and interactive engagements, redolent of a world that
affects us, that persuades us prior to symbolicity. <span class="attribution">Thomas Rickert, <strong>Ambient Rhetoric</strong> (34)</span>
</aside>

<p>When the piece was presented at the conference, a mobile phone camera was
used to record the performance. The camera captures the narrator speaking
and singing in the lecture hall. At moments during the second half of the video,
two vocal tracks with the narrator speaking or singing can be heard. After the conference,
the narration and singing was recorded again using a vocal microphone. The final
compilation brings together the phone footage, the  video presented at the
conference, and a final audio track. At select moments, the opacities and sound
levels are adjusted to bring to the surface the various elements. The
video track that was played at the conference also includes numerous background
sounds--thunder, nature, chickens. Reading these many visual and sonic layers as
scholarly claims calls for attention to what Rickert describes as an
"environment [that] becomes a weave of musical, semantic, and visual
communication flows" (138). The challenge is accepting these flows as possibilities along with familiar
forms of sharing and representing academic knowledge.</p>

<p>In screen composing, we extend familiar modes of moving information and work
with "sounds and sights [that] immerse us in a multisensory, spatial
environment, one pulsing with strong affective and suasive forces" (138).
Rickert notes that these modes "extend beyond our immediate cognitive focus" and
that "nonsemantic" elements like "emotional modulations" make it difficult to
account for composing with sounds and visuals using traditional information
schemes. In discussing ambience, Rickert suggests, "music becomes its own
affective ground" (29) as it evokes emergent experiences where "various feedback
loops arise--sonic, affective, haptic, performative--and transform the music at
every moment" (29). As music emerges, composing or reading among these loops
becomes an immersive experience, one that unfolds together with "the ambient
environs in which it emerges" (139).</p>


<p>And these loops need not be limited to sonic mixings. In describing the
paintings of Emily Kngwarreye, Erin Manning notes a similar "rhythm of the land"
(181) that includes "the weather, the seasons, the births and deaths, the
rituals and performances" (181). Like Rickert, Manning evokes affect in
discussing immersive experiences, noting that "we must feel these occasions of
experience in their eventness" (64). The experience is co-emergent and links
composer to environment as "there is no inside/outside to the sensations: they
are as much of the body as of the land, extending synesthetically beyond all
comprehension of three-dimensional space-time" (181). Screen composers
can draw from Manning's focus on the "capacity to create experiential space-times"
rather than familiar notions of "content" (64). Like the banal
particularity of a wheelbarrow as the weather shifts from clouds to sun,
"transformation entails a shift in affective tone such that the participating
spectator feels the performance" (64).
