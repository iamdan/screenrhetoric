<div class="panel">
<p>This video was originally performed at the Conference on College Composition and Communication in 2017. It combines cell phone video with videos taken from the internet and videos of student data projects. These materials are mixed as shifting layers with varying opacities in the video. It also includes music and sound effects. The transcript below captures the narration and major textual and media elements.
</p>
<p>00:00 Opening title reads: Tweet Analysis, Ambiguity, and Storytelling. A cursor appears on screen and adds text to the title that reads: A Dialog. Below the title appears the text: Daniel Anderson iamdan@unc.edu. The cursor adds @iamdan. The cursor highlights and then deletes all of the text on the title screen, and then begins typing. A computer-generated voice reads aloud the text being typed: See there is this thing called writing. And it’s great.
</p>
<p>00:30 The narrator’s voice responds: I love writing. But I’m supposed to be here to talk about data. Writing. . . . ah, I mean data is so cool. Look at how it helps us make sense of something like an election. On screen web articles discussing the 2016 election and data appear. Okay. Maybe I should rethink that. The 2016 presidential election was about the death of data, and the rise of stories.
 </p>
<p>00:52 The computer-generated voice speaks: It's not that politics don't matter, but writing, now that's a human activity.
</p>
<p>01:06 The narrator’s voice responds: I don’t know. Death is so serious. At most, maybe data just had a bad day. And if the point is to tell stories and write our lives, data is doing that even as we speak. And it’s kind of already political. And it’s kind of taken on a life of its own. Here it is built into an assignment. And here is someone using it for scholarship in the humanities, telling stories with it.
 </p>
<p>01:37. On screen an image of a web site with a class assignment appears. The narrator’s voice continues: And it’s really kind of interesting to play around with. We used this spreadsheet. It was surprisingly east to gather an archive of tweets. And then we could think about the terms that we might use to make sense of the tweets. We learned to think about data and tell some stories. Almost feels like a campfire.
</p>
<p>01:54 On screen a spreadsheet displays columns of tweets and related data. The narrator continues: And look what the machine put together for us. It’s so cool, all referenced with metadata and sortable. And watch this, we can run the tweets through a sentiment analysis analyzer. So cool. On screen a web site appears showing sentiment analysis figures for the Twitter hashtag, #posttruth. The figure shows a pie chart and bar graph with positive sentiment in green (23 responses, 85% and negative sentiment in red (4 responses, 15%).
</p>
<p>02:09 On screen a white layer appears and a cursor starts typing. The computer-generated voice speaks the text being typed: I don't think we are talking about the same thing. Sometimes you still need to draw a line
 </p>
<p>02:26 The narrator’s voice responds: I'm with you, probability 100, that computational analysis of postruth is bogus.
</p>
<p>02:32 On screen, tweets on the sentiment analysis web site are scrolled through. The narrator continues: Look at those tweets. Debates on the topic. Distopia. A wake up call. Posttruth is no positive development.
 </p>
<p>02:40 The sound of a train horn is heard at high volume. The computer-generated voice speaks: What is that?
</p>
<p>02:45 The narrator responds:  That's a train horn. They were amazing network makers in the analog days. Their horns sound lonesome.
 </p>
<p>02:50 The computer-generated voice speaks: I know that. I have access to all the databases.
 </p>
<p>02:55 The narrator speaks: It's cool that the trains run in Portland right through town, down by the river.
 </p>
<p>03:00 The computer-generated voice speaks: Yeah. Their horns sound lonesome.
 </p>
<p>03:05 The narrator speaks: Anyway, back to the tweets. We got about 1,000 of them cleaned up. And then we started assigning meaning to them, metadata. We all worked on the same spreadsheet, filling in data. And then our spreadsheet gave us these tools to computationally assist our coding.
</p>
<p>03:25 On screen a piechart in a spreadsheet shows the results of human-generated coding for positive and negative sentiment with positive sentiment in yellow (5.3%), neutral sentiment in red (32.7%) and negative sentiment in blue (62%) The narrator’s voice continues: The tweets weren't positive, obviously. We only found a positive sentiment 5.3% of the time.
 </p>
<p>03:33 The computer-generated voice speaks: I still don’t think we are on the same page. I’m talking shady characters and fuzzy operations, deep intrigue, the stuff of storytelling.
</p>
<p>03:42 The narrator speaks: Oh, this is fuzzy, and shady. Our 5.3 percent is just one study, but it feels right. Come on, just between me and you. It’s a lot of counting, interpreting, and representing. Maybe we can focus on the stories coming out of that process. Let’s look at those.
</p>
<p>04:00. On screen another spreadsheet appears. It contains data for the hashtags #notmypresident and #blacklivesmatter. A student voice speaks: I have chosen to mark as well as I can the emotions of each one within certain broad categories, the temporal focus, when is the tweet referring to. And does the tweet include a call to action no matter how big or how small.
</p>
<p>04:20 The narrator speaks: So, I asked everyone to share their discoveries from working with the data. Really, it’s pretty much like writing. It’s framing things, asking questions, representing ideas. And trying to make change in the world. In fact, the best part of the experience is the way it helps us question our basic assumptions.
 </p>
<p>04:39 On screen a student video appears. A student voice narrates the video on screen: Humans need to categorize everything. That’s the only way we can navigate in this world. But putting everything in boxes is problematic. What happens when the object does not fit. In the action of defining lines for when a term is in a category and when it’s outside lies a lot of judgment. Every word makes up for its own category: woman, sci-fi, horror, beautiful, nationality, clever, left-wing, truth, depression, art, etc. In the following I wish to investigate the three categories: human, computer, and, um, the category, category.
</p>
<p>05:23 On screen aerial footage shows two bridges over a river. The scene moves down the river as the camera flies over the bridges. The narrator speaks: I remember my dad told me a story about human development. He said, much boils down to accidents of eyes and ears. Somehow our eyes and ears evolved to either side of our heads, giving us binary brains, with switching and signals. He liked the long view. Just this week he told me things sometimes get worse before they get better. He said, what we’ve done follows from that change, from that binary brain. Our sight. Our smell. The way we walk. Our bridges. The streams of vapor we leave tracing the sky.
</p>
<p>06:05 On screen the camera continues to move over bridges and the river. The narrator continues speaking: I once wrote some poems about the organic mechanic. I layered one beneath an article about Mac and PC characters. The poems were about metaphors and the aesthetics and power of the materials and design in machines. The space shuttle. The telephone. I can tell, you bridges sing, my friend. Make no mistake about it, bridges sing.
 </p>
<p>06:36 The computer-generated voice speaks: Look, you can mix together all the people and machines you want; I still want to hear the sound of a human voice.
 </p>
<p>06:46 The narrator speaks: I hear you.
 </p>
<p>06:48 The computer-generated voice and the narrator speak in unison: Amen to that, my friend, amen. On screen, the camera flies over a bridge on which two light-rail trains are crossing. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>This piece brings together a few sources of several different kinds. A news item
opens up the piece. The item provides a few visuals that evoke the 2016
Presidential election, and then brings to light concerns related to data,
particularly by highlighting the phrase, "it was the day the data died."
screenshot of a scholarly article related to qualitative analysis of Twitter
data is also included. The piece also makes use of several images that depict
spreadsheets that have been populated with tweet-related data using the TAGS
(Twitter Archiving Google Spreadsheet) tool. These spreadsheets have been
developed around a number of data-oriented class activities. </p>

<p>There are two video clips that have been excerpted to provide some of the
visuals in the piece. Initially, a home video depicting figures on a train and
bridges around Portland Oregon is layered among the materials to emphasize human
and material connections. In the latter half of the video, excerpts from
"Portland, Oregon - Bridges from a Drone" play a prominent role in the closing
visuals. These are layered among other materials, and an excerpt from a video by
the band Explosions in the Sky is brought into the soundtrack. Opaque images
depicting downtown portland in Google Maps are also included.</p>

<p>The piece also inlcudes excerpts from two student projects. The projects were
created in a class called Digital Literature. Students were asked to conduct a
number of data-oriented activities and then to produce a media-based
"presentation that responds to the prompt: how are culture, community, and
identity mediated by technology?" Project by Adam Engel and Nete Biere have been
excerpted.</p>

<p>Finally, the video contains materials created by the author. A number of images
and videos have been recorded using a cell phone camera and are included here.
In addition, images and excerpts from the publication, "I'm a Map: I'm a Green
Tree" appear near the end of the piece.</p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<p>This video was origninally created as part of a panel presentation on data  in
composition studies at the 2017 Conference on
College Composition and Communication. This was a particularly challenging
presentation, as many at the time were experiencing a sense of data
shock after the 2016 US Presedentional election. At the time, questions about
the weight to give data in our interpretations and conclusions were pressing. And
the relationsip between data and storytelling seemed to be opening up.</p>


<aside class="pullquote-left"> Instead of waging the humans vs. robots war yet
again, couldn't we ask a different set of ethical questions: How does one judge
and evaluate the conflicting and competing narratives spun by machines and
humans? Ethical Programs 60</aside>

<p>The video directly evokes posthuman concerns as it concretizes a
human-machine dynamic through dialog. The conversation links human and machine
through the text-to-speech processing and the computer-generated voice. The
voice takes on the despondence associated with the "death of data" stories in
the news. The human narrator tries to console the machine by pointing out their
collaborations around data. James Brown Jr. suggests that these kinds of
overlapping activities emerge as algorithms act as rhetorical devices and as
humans develop "machinic thinking" (139). Even the approaches or heuristics
humans develop, from Brown's perspective, can be seen as "machines that enact
ethical programs and solve problems" (139). This blurring extends to the
relationship between data and narrative, as "the interpretation of data will
always require narrative" (138) and "narrative and data are not separable"
(136).</p>



<p>At around 01:26 in the video, the chime of a text message arriving can be
heard in the audio track of the piece. The chime alerts us to the live-writing
aesthetic of the video. The piece was composed by ripping snippets of material
quickly from online videos, capturing segments of typing on screen, and creating
cell phone footage. With these materials, computer-speech and sound effects were
mixed to create a video without the voice of the narrtor, which was added live
at the presentation (and has been recorded and added here). The many layers of
materials contain the kinds of ephemera we might expect to find in notes or
draft materials develped prior to delivering an academic
research presentation.</P>

<aside class="pullquote-right">The more profound challenge we face is to accept
the ambiguity of knowledge, the fundamentally interpreted condition on which
data is constructed. Joanna Drucker </aside>

<p>The dialog between the narrator and data is linked to networks and machines.
At 02:24, the connection disrupts the dialog in the form of an unexpected train
horn. The conversation veers toward the personal as the narrator describes the
emotional tenor of a train horn. The surprise of the machine indicates the
experience of the train horn is new. Here, posthumanism fully emerges as we
reach the logical conclusion of extending agency to non-human actors. In this
move, as Ian Bogost sums it up, "things constantly machinate within themselves
and mesh with one another, <em>acting</em> and <em>reacting</em> to properties
and states while still keeping something secret" (27). Graham Harman describes
these interactions as “interconnected, [but] always through indirect or
vicarious means” (192). The "properties and states" of the freight train are
linked with the moment and place of hearing and with the history of human
industry, and they recede even as they emerge in the sounding of the horn, which
is itself ambient and flowing with human affect. It's no wonder the computer has
trouble taking it in.</p>

<p>This emotional reasoning returns directly in the closing segments of the
poem. In addition to the narrator evoking parental stories, the visuals and
narration take up a series of poems created by the author. The poems explore the
beauty of machinic connections and the ways humans project emotion and capture
stories through machines. Much like the machinations or material tunings that
posthumanists deploy, Matthew Crawford offers a persona. register for such projections, "a
third thing, which is a kind of ethical involvement. [The mechanic] looks for
clues and causes only if he <em> cares</em> about the motor, in a personal way"
(95). The poems celebrating this involvement were hidden in the code of an
earlier publication, but one of them is brought to the surface here:</p>

<blockquote>
The organic mechanic
<br />sets his ring tone,
<br /> choosing bird chirps:
<br /> the peep in the poplar or,
<br />sometime later,
<br />in the inking evening
<br />the distant owl
<br />yopping its wahoo.
</blockquote>
