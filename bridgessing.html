<div class="panel">

  <p>This video was originally performed at the Conference on College Composition
and Communication in 2017. It combines mobile phone footage with videos taken from
the internet and student data projects. These materials are mixed as shifting
layers with varying opacities. The video also includes music and sound effects.
 </p>

  <p>00:00 The opening title reads: Tweet Analysis, Ambiguity, and Storytelling. A
  cursor appears on screen and adds text to the title that reads: A Dialog.
  Below the title appears the text: Daniel Anderson iamdan@unc.edu. The cursor
  adds @iamdan. The cursor highlights and then deletes all of the text on the
  title screen, and then begins typing. Video footage of bridges plays in the
  top fifth of the screen. An image of Donald Trump flashes briefly on screen, and then a
  computer-generated voice reads aloud the text being typed: “See there is this
  thing called writing. And it’s great.” </p>

  <p>00:30 The narrator’s voice responds: “I love writing. But I’m supposed to
  be here to talk about data. Writing. . . . ah, I mean data is so cool. Look at
  how it helps us make sense of something like an election.” On screen web
  articles discussing the 2016 election appear. The narrator continues:
  “Okay. Maybe I should rethink that. The 2016 presidential election was about
  the death of data, and the rise of stories." </p>

  <p>00:52 The computer-generated voice speaks: “It's not that politics don't
  matter, but writing, now that's a human activity.” A quote from Peggy Noonan
  about Americans’ relationship to data appears in the top fifth of the screen.
  </p>

  <p>01:06 Several layers of video and images appear on the screen, including
  video footage of a man looking out of a train window facing a bridge, screenshots of
  articles about the election, and a zoomable map of Portland, Oregon taken from
  Google Maps. The narrator’s voice responds: “I don’t know. Death is so
  serious. At most, maybe data just had a bad day. And if the point is to tell
  stories and write our lives, data is doing that even as we speak. And it’s
  kind of already political. And it’s kind of taken on a life of its own. Here
  it is built into an assignment. And here is someone using it for scholarship
  in the humanities, telling stories with it.” </p>

  <p>01:37. On screen an image of a web site with a class assignment appears.
  The assignment makes use of a spreadsheet for collecting Twitter data called TAGSExplorer, or TAGSv6.0. The narrator’s voice
  continues: “And it’s really kind of interesting to play around with. We used
  this spreadsheet. It was surprisingly easy to gather an archive of tweets. And
  then we could think about the terms that we might use to make sense of the
  many tweets. We learned to think about data and tell some stories--almost
  feels like a campfire.” </p>

  <p>01:54 On screen a spreadsheet displays columns of tweets and related data.
  The narrator continues: “And look what the machine put together for us. It’s
  so cool, all referenced with metadata and sortable. And watch this, we can run
  the tweets through a sentiment analysis algorithm. So cool.” On screen, a web
  site appears showing sentiment analysis figures for the Twitter hashtag,
  #posttruth. The figure shows a pie chart and bar graph with positive sentiment
  in green (23 responses, 85%) and negative sentiment in red (4 responses, 15%).
  </p>

  <p>02:09 On screen, a white layer appears and a cursor starts typing. The
  computer-generated voice speaks the text being typed: “I don't think we are
  talking about the same thing. Sometimes you still need to draw a line.” </p>

  <p>02:26 The narrator’s voice responds: “I'm with you, probability 100. That
  computational analysis of postruth is bogus.” </p>

  <p>02:32 On screen, tweets on the sentiment analysis web site are scrolled
  through. The narrator continues: “Look at those tweets. Debates on the topic.
  Dystopia. A wake up call. Posttruth is no positive development.” </p>

  <p>02:40 The sound of a train horn is heard at high volume. The
  computer-generated voice speaks: “What is that?” </p>

  <p>02:45 As Tweets continue to appear on screen, the narrator responds:
  “That's a train horn. They were amazing network makers in the analog days.
  Their horns sound lonesome.” </p>

  <p>02:50 The computer-generated voice speaks: “I know that. I have access to
  all the databases.” </p>

  <p>02:55 As the video of a train in a station faintly
  appears on screen, overlayed with the spreadsheet from the student assignment, the narrator speaks:
  “It's cool that they run in Portland right through town, down by the river.”
  </p>

  <p>03:00 The computer-generated voice speaks: “Yeah. Their horns sound
  lonesome.” </p>

  <p>03:05 The assignment spreadsheet fills the screen. The narrator speaks:
  “Anyway, back to the tweets. We got about 1,000 of them cleaned up. And then
  we started assigning meaning to them--metadata. We all worked on the same
  spreadsheet, filling in data. And then our spreadsheet gave us these tools to
  computationally assist our coding.” </p>

  <p>03:25 On screen, a pie chart in a spreadsheet shows the results of
  human-generated coding for positive and negative sentiment, with positive
  sentiment in yellow (5.3%), neutral sentiment in red (32.7%) and negative
  sentiment in blue (62%). The narrator’s voice continues: "The tweets weren't
  positive, obviously. We only found a positive sentiment 5.3% of the time.”
  </p>

  <p>03:33 The computer-generated voice speaks: “I still don’t think we are on
  the same page. I’m talking shady characters and fuzzy operations, deep
  intrigue, the stuff of storytelling.” </p>

  <p>03:42 As a network visualization appears on screen, the narrator speaks:
  “Oh, this is fuzzy, and shady. Our 5.3 percent is just one study, but it feels
  right. Come on, just between me and you: it’s a lot of counting, interpreting,
  and representing. Maybe we can focus on the stories coming out of that
  process. Let’s look at those.” </p>

  <p>04:00. On screen, another spreadsheet appears. It contains data for the
  hashtags #notmypresident and #blacklivesmatter. A student voice speaks: “I
  have chosen to mark as well as I can the emotions of each one within certain
  broad categories, the temporal focus, when is the tweet referring to. And does
  the tweet include a call to action no matter how big or how small.” </p>

  <p>04:20 The narrator speaks, over the sound of soft music and, at one point,
  the sound of a train: “So, I asked everyone to share their discoveries from
  working with the data. Really, it’s pretty much like writing. It’s framing
  things, asking questions, representing ideas. And trying to make change in the
  world. In fact, the best part of the experience is the way it helps us
  question our basic assumptions.” </p>

  <p>04:39 On screen, a student video appears, showing footage of people and
  places all over the world. A student voice narrates the video on screen:
  “Humans need to categorize everything. That’s the only way we can navigate in
  this world. But putting everything in boxes is problematic. What happens when
  the object does not fit? In the action of defining lines for when a term is in
  a category and when it’s outside lies a lot of judgment. Every word makes up
  for its own category: woman, sci-fi, horror, beautiful, nationality, clever,
  left-wing, truth, depression, art, etc. In the following I wish to investigate
  the three categories: ‘human,’ ‘computer,’ and, um, the category, ‘category.’”
  </p>

  <p>05:23 On screen, aerial footage shows two bridges over a river. The scene
  moves down the river as the camera flies over the bridges. The narrator
  speaks: “I remember my dad told me a story about human development. He said,
  much boils down to accidents of eyes and ears. Somehow our eyes and ears
  evolved to either side of our heads, giving us binary brains, with switching
  and signals. He liked the long view. Just this week he told me things
  sometimes get worse before they get better. He said, what we’ve done follows
  from that change, from that binary brain. Our sight. Our smell. The way we
  walk. Our bridges. The streams of vapor we leave tracing the sky.” </p>

  <p>06:05 On screen, the camera continues to move over bridges and the river.
  The image of PC and Mac characters from Apple Computer's "Get a Mac" advertising campaign appear on screen, along with source code showing a
  poem. The narrator continues speaking: “I once wrote some poems about the
  organic mechanic. I layered one beneath an article about Mac and PC
  characters. The poems were about metaphors and the aesthetics and power of the
  materials and design of machines. The space shuttle. The telephone. I can
  tell, you bridges sing, my friend. Make no mistake about it, bridges sing.”
  </p>

  <p>06:36 The computer-generated voice speaks, as typing appears on screen:
  “Look, you can mix together all the people and machines you want; I still want
  to hear the sound of a human voice.” </p>

  <p>06:46 The narrator speaks: “I hear you.” </p>

  <p>06:48 The computer-generated voice and the narrator speak in unison: “Amen to that, my friend, amen.” On screen, the camera flies over a bridge on which two light-rail trains are crossing. The video ends.

<div class="panel">



  <p>This video includes samples from articles: a news item
  opens up the piece, and a
  screenshot of a scholarly article related to qualitative analysis of Twitter
  data is included. The piece also makes use of several images that depict
  spreadsheets that have been populated with tweet-related data using the TAGS
  (Twitter Archiving Google Spreadsheet) tool. These spreadsheets have been
  developed around a number of data-oriented class activities. </p>

  <p>In the latter half of the video, excerpts from
  "Portland, Oregon - Bridges from a Drone" play a prominent role in the closing
  visuals. These are layered among other materials, and an audio excerpt from a performance by
  the band Explosions in the Sky is brought into the soundtrack. Opaque images
  depicting downtown Portland in Google Maps are also included.</p>

  <p>The piece also includes excerpts from two student projects. The projects were
  created in a class called Digital Literature. Students were asked to conduct a
  number of data-oriented activities, and then to produce a media-based
  presentation that responds to the prompt: how are culture, community, and
  identity mediated by technology? Projects by Adam Engel and Nete Biere have been
  excerpted with permission.</p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<p>This video was originally created as part of a panel presentation on data  in
composition studies at the 2017 Conference on
College Composition and Communication. This was a particularly challenging
presentation, as many at the time were experiencing a sense of data
shock after the 2016 US Presidential election. At the time, questions about
the role data in of data in political campaigns were pressing. And
scholars were actively interrogating the relationships among data, truth, and storytelling.</p>


<aside class="pullquote-left"> Instead of waging the humans vs. robots war yet
again, couldn't we ask a different set of ethical questions: How does one judge
and evaluate the conflicting and competing narratives spun by machines and
humans?  <span class="attribution">James Brown Jr., <strong>Ethical
Programs</strong> (60) </span></aside>

<p>The video directly evokes posthuman concerns as it concretizes a
human-machine dynamic through dialog. The conversation links humans and machines
through text-to-speech processing and the computer-generated voice. The
computer's voice takes on the despondence associated with the "death of data" stories in
the news. The human narrator tries to console the machine by pointing out their
collaborations around data. James Brown Jr. suggests that these kinds of
overlapping activities emerge as algorithms act as rhetorical devices and as
humans develop "machinic thinking" (139). Even the approaches or heuristics
humans develop, from Brown's perspective, can be seen as "machines that enact
ethical programs and solve problems" (139). This blurring extends to the
relationships between data and narrative, as "the interpretation of data will
always require narrative" (138) and "narrative and data are not separable"
(136).</p>



<p>At around 01:26 in the video, the chime of a text message arriving can be
heard in the audio track of the piece. The chime alerts us to the live-writing
aesthetic of the video. The piece was composed by capturing snippets of material
quickly from online videos, recording segments of typing on screen, and creating
mobile phone footage. With these materials, computer-speech and sound effects were
mixed to create a video without the voice of the narrator, which was added live
at the presentation (and was later recorded and added here). The many layers of
materials contain the kinds of ephemera we might expect to find in notes or
drafts developed prior to delivering an academic
research presentation.</P>

class="attribution">Joanna Drucker, "Humanities Approaches to Graphical
Display"</span> </aside>

<p>The dialog between the narrator and data is linked to networks and machines.
At 02:24, an unexpected sound disrupts the dialog in the form of a train
horn. The conversation veers, as the narrator describes the
emotional tenor of a train horn. The surprise of the machine indicates the
experience of the train horn is new. Here, posthumanism fully emerges as we
reach the logical conclusion of extending agency to non-human actors. These
linkages and thing-agencies, however, are always elusive. As Ian
Bogost sums it up, "things constantly machinate within themselves and mesh with
one another, <em>acting</em> and <em>reacting</em> to properties and states
while still keeping something secret" (27). Graham Harman describes these
interactions as “interconnected, [but] always through indirect or vicarious
means” (192). The "properties and states" of the freight train are linked with
the moment and place of hearing and with the history of human industry, and they
recede even as they emerge in the interrupting sound, which is itself ambient
and flowing with human affect. It's no wonder the computer has trouble taking it
in.</p>

<p>This posthuman longing for connection plays out in the dialog between human and machine, particularly in the closing segments of the
poem. At 06:17, the visuals and
narration take up a series of poems created by the author. The poems explore the
beauty of machinic connections and the ways humans project emotion and capture
stories through machines. Matthew Crawford suggests that, "[the mechanic] looks for
clues and causes only if he [sic] <em> cares</em> about the motor, in a personal way"
(95). The poems celebrating this involvement were hidden in the code of an
earlier publication, but one is brought to the surface here:</p>

<blockquote>
The organic mechanic
<br />sets his ring tone,
<br /> choosing bird chirps:
<br /> the peep in the poplar or,
<br />sometime later,
<br />in the inking evening
<br />the distant owl
<br />yopping its wahoo!
</blockquote>
