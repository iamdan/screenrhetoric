    This video was originally performed at the Conference on College
    Composition and Communication in 2017. It includes mobile phone footage
    from the conference location, Portland, Oregon. This footage was combined
    with videos and a partial audio track. For the academic presentation, the
    author spoke over this partial audio track. Afterwards, a new audio track
    with spoken narration was recorded for the version here.
</p>
<p>
    The video includes screen recordings of student projects and web materials.
    These materials provide samples that demonstrate engagements with data.
    There is also a dialog between the narrator and a computer-generated voice.
    A musical track plays quietly in parts of the video. A motif related to
    trains also appears in the sonic and visual elements of the piece.
</p>
 
 <h3>Transcript</h3>

  <p>
    00:00 The video opens with a title: "Tweet Analysis, Ambiguity, and
    Storytelling." A cursor appears on screen and adds text to the title that
    reads "A Dialog." Below the title appears the text: "Daniel Anderson
    iamdan@unc.edu." The cursor adds "@iamdan." The cursor highlights and then
    deletes all of the text on the title screen, and then begins typing. Video
    footage of bridges plays in the top fifth of the screen. An image of Donald
    Trump flashes briefly on screen, and then a computer-generated voice reads
    aloud the text being typed: "See there is this thing called writing. And
    it's great."
</p>
<p>
    00:30 The narrator's voice responds: "I love writing. But I'm supposed to
    be here to talk about data. Writing . . . ah, I mean data is so cool. Look
    at how it helps us make sense of something like an election." On screen,
    web articles discussing the 2016 US presidential election appear. The
    narrator continues: "Okay. Maybe I should rethink that. The 2016 election
    was about the death of data, and the rise of stories."
</p>
<p>
    00:52 The computer-generated voice speaks: "It's not that politics don't
    matter, but writing, now that's a human activity." A quote from Peggy
    Noonan about Americans' relationship to data appears in the top fifth of
    the screen: "In America now only normal people can see the obvious.
    Everyone else is lost in a data-filled fog."
</p>
<p>
    01:06 Several layers of video and images appear on screen, including video
    footage of a man looking out a train window facing a bridge, screenshots of
    articles about the election, and a zoomable map of Portland, Oregon taken
    from Google Maps. The narrator's voice responds: "I don't know. Death is so
    serious. At most, maybe data just had a bad day. And if the point is to
    tell stories and write our lives, data is doing that even as we speak. And
    it's kind of already political. And it's kind of taken on a life of its
    own." On screen, an image of a website with a class assignment appears. The
    window shows the title of the assignment: "Curating and Analyzing Tweets."
    The narrator continues: "Here it is built into an assignment." On screen,
    an image of a website with an article appears. The window shows the title
    of the article: "Baby We Were Born to Tweet: Springsteen Fans, the Writing
    Practices of In Situ Tweeting, and the Research Possibilities for Twitter."
    The narrator continues: "And here is someone using it for scholarship in
    the humanities, telling stories with it."
</p>
<p>
    01:37. The narrator's voice continues: "And it's really kind of interesting
    to play around with. We used this spreadsheet. It was surprisingly easy to
    gather an archive of tweets. And then we could think about the terms that
    we might use to make sense of the many tweets. We learned to think about
    data and tell some stories—almost feels like a campfire."
</p>
<p>
    01:54 On screen, a spreadsheet displays columns of tweets and related data.
    The narrator continues: "And look what the machine put together for us.
    It's so cool, all referenced with metadata and sortable. And watch this, we
    can run the tweets through a sentiment analysis algorithm. So cool." On
    screen, a website appears showing sentiment analysis figures for the
    Twitter hashtag #posttruth. The figure shows a pie chart and bar graph with
    positive sentiment in green (twenty-three responses, 85%) and negative
    sentiment in red (four responses, 15%).
</p>
<p>
    02:09 On screen, a white layer appears and a cursor starts typing. The
    computer-generated voice speaks the text being typed: "I don't think we are
    talking about the same thing. Sometimes you still need to draw a line."
</p>
<p>
    02:26 The narrator's voice responds: "I'm with you, probability 100. That
    computational analysis of posttruth is bogus."
</p>
<p>
    02:32 On screen, tweets on the sentiment analysis website are scrolled
    through. The narrator continues: "Look at those tweets. Debates on the
    topic. Dystopia. A wake-up call. Posttruth is no positive development."
</p>
<p>
    02:40 The sound of a train horn is heard at high volume. The
    computer-generated voice speaks: "What is that?"
</p>
<p>
    02:45 As tweets continue to appear on screen, the narrator responds:
    "That's a train horn. They were amazing network makers in the analog days.
    Their horns sound lonesome."
</p>
<p>
    02:50 The computer-generated voice speaks: "I know that. I have access to
    all the databases."
</p>
<p>
    02:55 As video of a train in a station faintly appears on screen, overlaid
    with the spreadsheet from the class assignment, the narrator speaks: "It's
    cool that they run in Portland right through town, down by the river."
</p>
<p>
    03:00 The computer-generated voice speaks: "Yeah. Their horns sound
    lonesome."
</p>
<p>
    03:05 The assignment spreadsheet fills the screen. The narrator speaks:
    "Anyway, back to the tweets. We got about 1,000 of them cleaned up. And
    then we started assigning meaning to them—metadata. We all worked on the
    same spreadsheet, filling in data. And then our spreadsheet gave us these
    tools to computationally assist our coding."
</p>
<p>
    03:25 On screen, a pie chart in a spreadsheet shows the results of
    human-generated coding for positive and negative sentiment, with positive
    sentiment in yellow (5.3%), neutral sentiment in red (32.7%), and negative
    sentiment in blue (62%). The narrator's voice continues: "The tweets
    weren't positive, obviously. We only found a positive sentiment 5.3 percent
    of the time."
</p>
<p>
    03:33 The computer-generated voice speaks: "I still don't think we are on
    the same page. I'm talking shady characters and fuzzy operations, deep
    intrigue, the stuff of storytelling."
</p>
<p>
    03:42 As a network visualization appears on screen, the narrator speaks:
    "Oh, this is fuzzy, and shady. Our 5.3 percent is just one study, but it
    feels right. Come on, just between me and you: it's a lot of counting,
    interpreting, and representing. Maybe we can focus on the stories coming
    out of that process. Let's look at those."
</p>
<p>
    04:00. On screen, a student video containing another spreadsheet appears.
    It shows data for the hashtags #notmypresident and #blacklivesmatter. A
    student voice speaks: "I have chosen to mark as well as I can the emotions
    of each one within certain broad categories, the temporal focus, when is
    the tweet referring to. And does the tweet include a call to action no
    matter how big or how small."
</p>
<p>
    04:20 The narrator speaks, over the sound of soft music and, at one point,
    the sound of a train: "So, I asked everyone to share their discoveries from
    working with the data. Really, it's pretty much like writing. It's framing
    things, asking questions, representing ideas. And trying to make change in
    the world. In fact, the best part of the experience is the way it helps us
    question our basic assumptions."
</p>
<p>
    04:39 On screen, a student video appears, showing footage of people and
    places all over the world. A student voice narrates the video on screen:
    "Humans need to categorize everything. That's the only way we can navigate
    in this world. But putting everything in boxes is problematic. What happens
    when the object does not fit? In the action of defining lines for when a
    term is in a category and when it's outside lies a lot of judgment. Every
    word makes up for its own category: woman, sci-fi, horror, beautiful,
    nationality, clever, left-wing, truth, depression, art, etc. In the
    following I wish to investigate the three categories: 'human,' 'computer,'
    and, um, the category, 'category.'"
</p>
<p>
    05:23 On screen, aerial footage shows two bridges over a river. The scene
    moves down the river as the camera flies over the bridges. In the
    background, sparse guitar sounds are heard as a music track begins to play
    softly. The narrator speaks: "I remember my dad told me a story about human
    development. He said, much boils down to accidents of eyes and ears.
    Somehow our eyes and ears evolved to either side of our heads, giving us
    binary brains, with switching and signals. He liked the long view. Just
    this week he told me things sometimes get worse before they get better. He
    said, what we've done follows from that change, from that binary brain. Our
    sight. Our smell. The way we walk. Our bridges. The streams of vapor we
    leave tracing the sky." The intensity of the song in the background begins
    to pick up.
</p>
<p>
    06:05 On screen, the camera continues to move over bridges and the river.
    The image of PC and Mac characters from Apple's "Get a Mac" advertising
    campaign appear on screen, along with source code showing a poem. The
    narrator continues speaking: "I once wrote some poems about the organic
    mechanic. I layered one beneath an article about Mac and PC characters. The
    poems were about metaphors and the aesthetics and power of the materials
    and design of machines. The space shuttle. The telephone. I can tell, you
    bridges sing, my friend. Make no mistake about it, bridges sing."
</p>
<p>
    06:36 The computer-generated voice speaks, as typing appears on screen:
    "Look, you can mix together all the people and machines you want; I still
    want to hear the sound of a human voice." The musical track continues to
    play.
</p>
<p>
    06:46 The narrator speaks: "I hear you."
</p>
<p>
    06:48 The computer-generated voice and the narrator speak in unison: "Amen
    to that, my friend, amen." On screen, the camera flies over a bridge on
    which two light-rail trains are crossing. The musical track fades out. The
    video ends.

    This video includes samples from articles: a news item opens up the piece,
    and a screenshot of a scholarly article related to qualitative analysis of
    Twitter data is included. The piece also makes use of several images that
    depict spreadsheets that have been populated with tweet-related data using
    the TAGS (Twitter Archiving Google Spreadsheet)
    tool. These spreadsheets (developed as part of class activities) include
    categories for making sense of the collected tweets.
</p>
<p>
    In the latter half of the video, excerpts from "Portland, Oregon—Bridges
    from a Drone" are layered among other materials while a performance of the
    song "Your Hand in Mine" by the band Explosions in the Sky is brought into
    the soundtrack. Opaque images depicting downtown Portland in Google Maps
    are also included. The piece also includes excerpts from two projects
    created in a class called Digital Literature. For the projects, students
    studied Twitter conversations, and then produced a video exploring culture,
    community, and identity.

<h4>Discussion</h4>




<aside class="pullquote-left">Instead of waging the humans vs. robots war yet again, couldn't we ask a
    different set of ethical questions: How does one judge and evaluate the
    conflicting and competing narratives spun by machines and humans? <span class="attribution">James Brown Jr., <span class="attribution-title">Ethical
Programs</span> (60) </span></aside>

<p>
    This video was originally created as part of a panel presentation on data
    in composition studies. This was a particularly challenging presentation,
    as many were experiencing a sense of data shock after the 2016 US
    presidential election. At the time, questions about the role of data in
    political campaigns were pressing. And scholars were interrogating
    relationships among data, truth, and storytelling, wrestling with the sense
    that data and machines had gotten everything wrong. <em>Bridges Sing</em>
    explores these concerns through dialog between the narrator's voice and a
    voice created through text-to-speech processing. The computer's voice takes
    on the despondence associated with the "death of data" stories in the news
    after the election. The human narrator consoles the machine by pointing out
    their connections. James Brown Jr. explains that human-machine boundaries
    blur as algorithms act as rhetorical devices and as humans develop
    "machinic thinking" (139). This overlap extends to the relationships
    between data and narrative, since "the interpretation of data will always
    require narrative" (138) and "narrative and data are not separable" (136).
    Much like the processes and operating systems of computers, from Brown's
    perspective, the approaches that humans develop can be seen as "machines
    that enact ethical programs and solve problems" (139).
</p>
<p>
    Though they work together in the dialog, the human and machine are not the
    same. At around 01:26 in the video, the chime of a text message alerts us
    to human engagements beyond the screen and the creative energies of
    serendipity. Roland Barthes tells us, as we create or interpret messages,
"the language must include the 'surprises' of meaning" (47). But surprises of meaning run counter to typical
    approaches to computers and data. Cathy O'Neil warns of the efficiency that
    filters out any noisy surprises "as automated systems [chomp] away on our
    error-ridden dossiers" (155). When it comes to data and machines, the
    difficulties extend beyond the glitches that arise with surprise. "For all
    their advances in logic and language," O'Neil explains, computers "still
    struggle mightily with concepts. They 'understand' beauty only as a word
associated with the Grand Canyon, ocean sunsets, and grooming tips in    <em>Vogue</em> magazine" (95). Beautiful surprises belong to humans, though
    we long to extend them to our computational companions.

<p>
    The dialog between the narrator and data is linked to networks and
    machines. At 02:44, another unexpected sound, a train horn, disrupts the
    video. The conversation veers as the narrator describes the emotional tenor
    of the horn. The surprise of the machine indicates the experience of the
    sound is new. Here, we reach one conclusion of posthuman extensions of
    agency to nonhuman actors. These thing-agencies
    are always elusive. As Ian Bogost sums it up, "Things constantly machinate
    within themselves and mesh with one another, acting and reacting to
    properties and states while still keeping something secret" (27). Graham
    Harman describes these interactions as "interconnected, [but] always
    through indirect or vicarious means" (192). The "properties and states" of
    trains are linked with our own moments of apprehension and with human
    industry, and they recede even as they emerge in the interrupting sound of
    the horn, which is itself ambient and flowing with affect and ambiguity.
    It's no wonder the computer has trouble processing it.
</p>
<p>
    A longing for connection plays out in the dialog between human and machine,
    particularly in the closing segments of the video. At 06:17, the visuals
    and narration take up a series of poems created by the author. The poems
    explore the beauty of machinic connections and the ways humans express
    creativity and capture stories through (and with) machines. Matthew
    Crawford suggests that the mechanic who sees beneath the surface "cares
    about the motor, in a personal way" (95). The poems celebrating this
    involvement were hidden in the code of an earlier publication, and one is
    brought to the surface here:
</p>


<blockquote>
The organic mechanic
<br />sets his ring tone,
<br /> choosing bird chirps:
<br /> the peep in the poplar or,
<br />sometime later,
<br />in the inking evening
<br />the distant owl
<br />yopping its wahoo!
</blockquote>
