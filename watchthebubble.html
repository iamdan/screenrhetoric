  <p>This video brings together online articles that have been published by the author. It also
includes a video of a live musical performance hosted by YouTube, materials taken from a class website,
a blog posting created by the author, and a drawing application window, on which
shapes are manipulated in the opening of the video. These materials are
displayed in web browser windows that are captured using a screen recorder.
 </p>

  <p>00:00 The video opens with a window from an image editing program on the screen;
  the word “highlights” appears above gear-like graphics. The cursor manipulates
  objects in the window while the narrator speaks:  “What happens when
  you mix memoir with music, video, and words? You get multimedia manifesto. And
  when you reflect through--as well as about--media composing, you get moments
  like these, captured on screen. I’m searching for some sound. There’s a shared
  response with the machine.” </p>

  <p>00:20 The cursor brings forward a web browser window showing the heading,
  “The Time is Meow,” selects the search field, and types: “explosions in the
  sky.” From the search results, the cursor selects a video on the YouTube web site by the band Explosions in the Sky.
  The video loads into the browser window. The narrator continues: “Let’s play a
  YouTube clip. Let’s adjust this a little bit. Let’s think about how to arrange
  these pieces. About scale and movement. Focus. Time.” </p>

  <p>00:40 The cursor resizes the web browser window with the YouTube clip and
  moves the window to the upper-right of the screen. In the video the band begins
  to play. Above the clip appears the name of the band and the song: “Explosions in the Sky –
  Six Days At The Bottom Of The Ocean.” The image editing program is again selected,
  and a menu of color choices appears in a small dialog box. The graphics in the
 program are resized and rearranged. The narrator continues: "Let’s get a feel
  for the music. For the mood. Let’s play with this image, create what we want
  to say with these materials. Layers, shapes, words, that launch us into
  memory." </p>

  <p>01:00 The narrator continues: “When I was about six I went to the Twelve
  Gates free school and this was in the ‘60s. It was a hippie school. The only
  rule was the teachers couldn't tell you what to do. We wandered downtown,
  scouring the city. But I soon had to go to public school and I was still just
  six, and the first thing I did was say “shit” . . . and had my mouth washed
  out with soap.” </p>

  <p>01:25 A call-out appears on screen with text overlaid on an image of a bubble: “What
  would you change about education?” The narrator continues: “My first question
  is personal. What one thing would you change about education?” </p>

  <p>01:40 In the YouTube window, the music picks up in intensity. The Texas flag is
  visible, despite the dark sepia tones of the video. The narrator continues: “My
  teaching memories start with 1993, my first time in a computer classroom. I
  put my PC disk in a Mac and erased my syllabus on the first day. That
  accident was the warm sun on my face. The response was electric. Do you want
  to reformat? Just click okay.” </p>

  <p>02:08 A web browser window is opened on the left half of the screen
  containing an online article called, “Not Maimed but Malted.” The cursor clicks
  through the hypertext essay, lingering for a moment on paragraph 17. A bubble
  callout appears, reading: “Tweak first. . . ." The narrator continues: “The
  second memory weaves together teaching and composing beyond words. We learned
  to layer ideas with images, sounds, language. We learned to mark up text and
  talk to servers to write the Web. We learned to code to help the Web write
  back. Which leads to an affirmation. Digital composing is comfortable with
  learning to learn, with technical play, with ephemera, disappearance." On screen, a bubble
  callout appears, reading: “Theorize later.” The narrator continues: "With
  tweak first, theorize later. With what we call emergence--that edge where
  chaos and composing come together as creativity plays out.” </p>

  <p>02:52 A file system window is brought on screen and the cursor clicks
  through a series of folders. The folder names are: “The organic mechanic /
  sets his ring tone, / choosing bird chirps-- / the peep in the poplar / or,
  sometime later, / in the inking evening / the distant owl / yopping its /
  wahoo.” In the hypertext essay, a header reads: “the Mixing of Text and
  Graphics.” </p>

  <p>03:05 The cursor selects a file in the file system window and drags it into
  a web browser window. The file contains an article titled,
  “hybrid://literature, cognition, design,” which fills the left side of the
  screen. A callout appears, reading: “What have we learned from our first
  questions?” The narrator continues: "But we still made claims and drew
  conclusions: ‘our thinking is like a network,’ ‘the computer will democratize
  literature, writing, education,’ ‘this changes everything,’ ‘This is total
  disruption.’ And it was instantiation of the theories—post-structural
  networks, fluid texts, shifting authors. We saw <em>The Electronic Word</em> and
  realized, ‘the critical/creation dichotomy automatically breaks down in a
  digital world.’” </p>

  <p>03:35 A callout appears on screen: “What does it mean to tinker?”
  In the window with the live performance by Explosions in the Sky, the musicians are jamming, the drummer crashing on his kit. The
  narrator continues: “In the ‘90s, we were hacking away at the Web, trying to
  make it writable. Which brings us to the do-it-yourself attitude of the
  digital, the studio or shop class suited for tweaking and tuning materials,
  for working with hands and minds.” </p>

  <p>03:51 A new file system window is brought on screen and the cursor selects
  a file and drags it into the web browser window. An article opens, titled
  “Prosumer Approaches to New Media Composition.” The hypertext essay is filled
  with videos and images; the narrator’s face and others’ appear in small video
  windows embedded in the article. The narrator continues: “So my introduction
  to formalized education was rough. But I still had some wonderful teachers. In
  second grade, on another first day, Mrs. Buchannon told me, ‘stick to your
  guns’ when you think you're right. Looking past the ratty hair and backing
  the new kid, she showed me that learning is about risk and trust.” The live musical performance has nearly fallen silent; only one electric guitar sounds, a single note
  at a time. The cursor continues to navigate the “Prosumer” article as the
  narrator describes the piece: “In digital history, this piece on screen is
  2003, and this is multimedia taking root. This moment is a response to programs
  like iMovie and the lowering of technical hurdles. This is the prosumer-push,
  full throttle.” </p>

  <p>O4:45 Two callouts appear on the right of the screen. The first callout reads: “Can we
  just talk about. . . .” The second callout reads: “. . . or must we do DIY?” A new web browser window
  is brought on screen containing a class portfolio created by student Zach
  Cross; the cursor scrolls through and lingers on a few paragraphs. The
  narrator continues: “My best class ever was auto shop in high school. My
  mentor, Erwin Schlaack, taught me to recognize poetry in mechanical things.
  Life lessons like torque applied to metal bolt, the breaking point, the
  backing off, the just right moment, which leads me to another question: what
  should be our teaching philosophy?” </p>

  <p>05:05 A call-out appears on screen: “What is the teaching philosophy of
  computers and writing?” The cursor continues to scroll through the student
  portfolio. The narrator continues: “The digital should be a place for
  experimentation, a place where you can try something. Who knows what will
  happen? We all can reflect on and practice creative response. Every project
  should be a revelation. It's okay not to know how to do something. It's okay
  to make mistakes.” </p>

  <p>05:35 Two callouts appear on screen as the cursor continues to scroll
  through Zach Cross’s portfolio. Callout one reads: “It’s okay. . . ." Callout two reads: ". . . to make mistakes.” The
  narrator continues: “When I first went to college, I brought my Mexican mesh
  bag stocked for the beach—Frisbee, sandals. When I took a second crack at a
  university, a teacher, Mike Fischer, taught me to write about ideas. I thought
  I'd take on deconstruction. I felt like literature didn't dissolve anything,
  but generated being through insights and emotions, 'thoughts too deep for
  tears.'” </p>

  <p>06:10 The web browser window with the student portfolio is minimized. A
  new web browser is brought on screen containing the article, “Yes and Yes-and:
  Time in the Compshop.” A callout bubble appears: “What are the new
  questions?” The narrator continues: “Then I started teaching with computers
  and found the bubble. Here, my life memories merge with my recollections of
  a field. I think of John Slatin, who taught me about texts and codes and
  working with those we love. We are the lab discipline of the humanities. The
  place where art, music, film, and story are cast together. Where beliefs are
  created in response to the material world. ‘The river is moving.’ Our writing
  is mixing.”  </p>

  <p>06:45 In the YouTube clip in the upper-right of the screen, the live
  performance of the song is increasing in intensity. A web browser window
  showing a blog posting is brought on screen, titled “Flying Forward and Back
  with Each Footfall.” The cursor scrolls through a poem in the posting. On screen, a callout appears: “a claim is coming.” The
  narrator continues: “We come to the connotational space still slick with
  linguistics. But I'm talking about extending the beating in the veins and
  tracing it all the way through software and symbol and sound and soundboard
  and keyboard. We find in the connotational space glowing image edge amid
  desktop under glass. We cast texts and songs and lights and people.” </p>

  <p>07:15 The cursor scrolls to the bottom of the blog posting and selects a
  link that says Add comment. A comment composing window appears. A callout
  appears: “A claim is coming . . . cast as a question.” The narrator continues:
  “I'm rolling toward the final question of the technopoet: ‘Oh . . . Do not ask . . .
  must we always manifesto?’ The question’s rhetorical. This moment is now
  emerging. Should we use this YouTube clip we’ve found? The question's
  rhetorical. How could we not? It's a part of this story, the memoir, the
  performance.” </p>

  <p>07:50 In the comment composing window, the cursor types text: “Just
  checking back. I’m thinking that local writerly stuff has gone global now, or
  just keeps slipping between the global and the local. Like a zoom tool
  switching our gaze.” The narrator continues: “This is the twenty-third take of
  a live improvisation. Twenty-three takes among hundreds of unsaved instances,
  coming and going like the folding edge of time. This is me typing into the
  take. This is you watching. This is me talking over the take. Us listening.
  Clicking. Moving sound. Beating. Playing with the band. Imagining. Us.
  Reworking the twenty-third take of a ten-minute moment.” </p>

  <p>08:25 The live musical performance increases in intensity. The video image
  zooms in on the comment composing screen, which becomes partially transparent and moves
  over the YouTube video, the comment text and the musicians filling the screen. The
  cursor continues to type: “It’s still about the prosumer push, the euphoric
  rush picking its way through membrane. Dance of light, pixelated insight.” The
  narrator continues: “I used to think the prosumer approach was important for
  teaching. Of course it is. But what I’ve learned is that the prosumer is not
  about school. It’s about everybody making everything. That means me and you.
  You don't create the prosumer, you prosume. You don't study digital composing,
  you perform it. ‘Must we always manifesto?’ Yes. The question is who will
  speak and what will we say as we cast our creations into the mix. The question
  is, what will we say?” </p>

  <p>09:15 The live musical performance comes to a crescendo. In the comment
  composing window the cursor has continued to type, images of the band commingle with words: “Heard through air vibration tools. The tympanic
  mechanic with hammer and drum . . . . . . . . . . drum drum drum. heart. ear.
  lung. This is me and my machine. This is the adumbrating edge where writing
  becomes writing.” The narrator continues: “We will say that words crash and
  sweep and wave, light speaks, and sounds have shape. Do we write these waves
  and shapes with our machines? Yes. Do we blow them into being like glass? Yes.
  Look closely—the surface, still liquid and light, refracts.” </p>

  <p>09:40 The view on screen zooms out, and the comment composing window shrinks to its original size and becomes
  more opaque. The band plays intensely on their instruments. The cursor
  continues to type: “The Mobius moment where cast is cast. Where the bus stops
  beyond language.” The narrator continues: “And when we bring the shimmering
  thing here before us, we will say to beauty: ‘this is truth.’ And we will say,
  ‘don't watch your mouth. Watch the bubble.’” The band finishes the live
  performance of the song. The video ends. </p>

<div class="panel">




  <p>The materials  include four articles, a YouTube-hosted video
  clip, and reflections from a student's course portfolio. There are also items
  created by the author, including blog postings and images. A video clip hosted
  on YouTube captures a live performance of the song, "Six Days at the Bottom of
  the Ocean," by the band, Explosions In The Sky. The song was recorded at The Parish
  in Austin, Tx on October 31st, 2003 and posted to YouTube on Mar 4, 2006.  </p>

  <p>
  The articles included in the piece link to
  moments in the histories of both the author and the field of computers and
  writing. The materials in the student portfolio show reflections on composing collages
  and other multimedia projects.  Student materials in this project are used with
  permission.  </p>

<h4>About the Video</h4>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> In an experimental humanities, students (and
teachers) learn to write original poetics. The value of these poetics may then
be tested by using them to see what sorts of work they help the students (or any
investigator) to generate . . . students become producers as well as consumers
of theory <span class="attribution">Gregory Ulmer, <strong>Heuretics</strong> (xiii)</span> </aside>

<p>A version of this piece was published in <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric,
Technology, and Pedagogy</em> in 2012. An earlier version
was performed at the 2011 Computers and Writing Conference. The video was made
by screen recording a live performance. An audio track and callout
bubbles were added to the screen capture later. The version here has been revised
using the original screen capture, an edited script, and repositioning of the
bubble callouts.</p>

<p>The educational encounters discussed in the video articulate a teaching
philosophy that is based on mentored engagement with the material world. Human
agency, Matthew Crawford suggests, "arises only within concrete limits that are
not our making" (64). A metal bolt can only take so much torque, and the
limits are best learned through guided experience. These constraints create the
conditions for learning. The situation and mechanics can vary. The
materials of language work well for mentoring. The shop class and computer lab
make great spaces for learning "why certain aspects of mechanical work can't be
reduced to rule following" (24). Learning requires wrestling with material situations that evoke insights and emotions. Crawford notes that we situate ourselves when we learn this way.</p>

</figure>
<p></p>
<aside class="pullquote-right">Knowing what <em>kind</em> of problem you have on
hand means knowing what features of the situation can be ignored. Even the
boundaries of what counts as "the situation" can be ambiguous; making
discriminations of pertinence cannot be achieved by the application of rules,
and requires a kind of judgment that comes with experience. <span class="attribution">Matthew Crawford, <strong>Shop Class as Soulcraft</strong> (36) </span></aside>

<p>Screen composing brings these material engagements to the fore, makes them
part of the performed message. Crawford worries that "the computer 'interface'
adds another layer of abstraction, as it screens the user also from the
human-generated logic of the program running the software" (60). We know this
screening flows with protocols, control, power, politics. We need not move away
from material engagements, though, as we compose with and through our
screens. And if we push the communicative affordances of interfaces, we can
reveal their materialities. Crawford worries that the interface is designed "to
introduce as little psychic friction as possible between the user's intention
and its realization" (Crawford 61). At 02:50 in the video, the cursor clicks
through a series of folders that have been named with lines of figurative
language, showing how resistance can be added with creative
representation--making poetry.</p>

<p>Gregory Ulmer builds upon Julia Kristeva's understanding of the concept of
chora as he outlines an approach to composing that he calls chorography, "a
process or movement of invention conducted as a transgression of rules (the
burlesque principle) that undermines the plausibility and verisimilitude of
classic mimesis, argumentation, judgment, realism" (176). This transgression
calls into question classic understandings of writing. Instead, "choral writing
is a kind of dreamwork . . . drawing on . . . 'the <em>passage from one sign
system to another</em>'" (76). The psychic resistance that Crawford seeks is
easily felt through this choral composing that creates transgressive movements
among, against, and with interfaces. Such experiences deliver unexpected shocks
that push the materiality of computing into view. Crawford's concern that "the
expanding empire of electronics <em>covers over</em> the mechanical" (61) is met
with the mechanics of screen composing that brings forth these bubbles of insight.
