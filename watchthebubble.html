<p>This video brings together online articles that have been published by the author. The video also includes a YouTube clip with live music. And the video includes materials taken from a class web site and blog created by the author. These materials are displayed in web browser windows that are captured using a screen recorder. The video also includes narration discussing aspects of teaching with computers and some of the history of the field of computers and writing. And the video contains a drawing application window, on which shapes are manipulated in the opening of the video. The video was first published in the journal, Kairos, in 2012.
</p>
<p>00:00 The video opens with a window from a drawing program on the screen. The cursor manipulates objects in the drawing window while the narrator speaks:  What happens when you mix memoir with music, video, and words? You get multimedia manifesto.  And when you reflect through as well as about media composing, you get moments like these, captured on screen. I’m searching for some sound. There’s a shared response with the machine.
</p>
<p>00:20 The cursor brings forward a web browser window, selects the search box, and types: explosions in the sky. The web browser loads search results, and then the cursor clicks on an item linking to a YouTube video by the band Explosions in the Sky. The video loads into the browser window. The narrator continues: Let’s play a YouTube clip. Let’s adjust this a little bit. Let’s think about how to arrange these pieces. About scale and movement. Focus. Time.
</p>
<p>00:40 The cursor resizes the web browser window with the YouTube clip and moves the window to the upper-right of the screen. In the clip the band begins to play. Above the clip appears the name of the song: Explosions in the Sky – Six Days At The Bottom Of The Ocean. The narrator continues: Let’s get a feel for the music. For the mood. Let’s play with this image, create what we want to say with these materials. Layers, shapes, words, that launch us into memory.
</p>
<p>01:00 The narrator continues: When I was about six I went to the Twelve Gates free school and this was in the ‘60s. It was a hippie school. The only rule was the teachers couldn't tell you what to do. We wandered downtown, scouring the city. But I soon had to go to public school and I was still just six, and the first thing I did was say shit . . . and had my mouth washed out with soap.
</p>
<p>01:25 A call-out appears on screen: What would you change about education. The narrator continues: My first question is personal. What one thing would you change about education?
</p>
<p>01:40 The narrator continues: My teaching memories start with 1993, my first time in a computer classroom. I put my PC disk in a Mac and erased my syllabus on the first day.  That accident was the warm sun on my face. The response was electric. Do you want to reformat? Just click okay.
</p>
<p>02:08 A web browser window is opened on the left half of the screen containing an online article called “Not Maimed but Malted.” The narrator continues: The second memory weaves together teaching and composing beyond words. We learned to layer ideas with images, sounds, language. We learned to mark up text and talk to servers to write the Web. We learned to code to help the Web write back, which leads to an affirmation. Digital composing is comfortable with learning to learn, with technical play, with ephemera, disappearance, with tweak first, theorize later, with what we call emergence, that edge where chaos and composing come together as creativity plays out.
</p>
<p>O2:52 A file system window is brought on screen and the cursor clicks through a series of folders. The folder names are: The organic mechanic / sets his ring tone, / choosing bird chirps-- / the peep in the poplar / or, sometime later, / in the inking evening / the distant owl / yopping its / wahoo.
</p>
<p>03:05 The cursor selects a file in the file system window and drags it into the web browser window. The file contains an article titled, “hybrid://literature, cognition, design.” The narrator continues: But we still made claims and drew conclusions “our thinking is like a network,” “the computer will democratize literature, writing, education,” “this changes everything.” “This is total disruption.” And it was instantiation of the theories—post-structural, networks, fluid texts, shifting authors. We saw The Electronic Word and realized, “the critical/creation dichotomy automatically breaks down in a digital world.”
</p>
<p>03:38 A call-out appears on screen: What does it mean to tinker? The narrator continues: In the ‘90s we were hacking away at the Web, trying to make it writable, which brings us to the do it yourself attitude of the digital, the studio or shop class suited for tweaking and turning materials, for working with hands and minds.
</p>
<p>03:55 A new file system window is brought on screen and the cursor selects a file and drags it into the web browser window. An article opens titled “Prosumer Approaches to New Media Composition.” The narrator continues:
So my introduction to formalized education was rough. But I still had some wonderful teachers. In second grade, on another first day, Mrs. Buchannon told me, "stick to your guns" when you think you're right. Looking past the ratty hair and backing the new kid, she showed me that learning is about risk and trust.

In digital history, this piece on screen is 2003, and this is multimedia taking root. This moment is a response to programs like iMovie and the lowering of technical hurdles. This is the prosumer push full throttle.
</p>
<p>O4:45 The cursor selects the minimize button, and the web browser window slides off screen. A new web browser window is brought on screen containing a class portfolio created by student Zach Cross. The narrator continues: My best class ever was auto shop in high school. My mentor, Erwin Schlaack, taught me to recognize poetry in mechanical things. Life lessons like torque applied to metal bolt, the breaking point, the backing off, the just right moment, which leads me to another question: what should be our teaching philosophy?
</p>
<p>05:10 A call-out appears on screen: What is the teaching philosophy of computers and writing. The narrator continues: The digital should be a place for experimentation, a place where you can try something. Who knows what will happen? We all can reflect on and practice creative production. Every project should be a revelation. It's okay not to know how to do something. It's okay to make mistakes.
</p>
<p>05:35 Two call-outs appear on screen: It’s okay . . . to make mistakes. The narrator continues: When I first went to college I brought my Mexican mesh bag stocked for the beach—Frisbee, sandals. When I took a second crack at a university, an teacher, Mike Fischer, taught me to write about ideas. I thought I'd take on deconstruction. I felt like literature didn't dissolve anything but generated being through insights and emotions. Thoughts too deep for tears.
</p>
<p>06:10 The web browser window with the student portfolios is minimized. A new web browser is brought on screen containing the article, “Yes and Yes-and: Time in the Compshop.” The narrator continues: Then I started teaching with computers and found the bubble. Here, my life memories merge with my recollections of a field. I think of John Slatin, who taught me about texts and codes and working with those we love. We are the lab discipline of the humanities. The place where art, music, film, and story are cast together. Where beliefs are created in response to the material world. "The river is moving." Our writing is mixing.
</p>
<p>06:45 In the YouTube clip in the upper-right of the screen the live performance of the song is increasing in intensity. On screen, a call-out appears: A claim is coming. The narrator continues: We come to the connotational space still slick with linguistics. But I'm talking about extending the beating in the veins and tracing it all the way through software and symbol and sound and soundboard and keyboard.
</p>
<p>07:02 The web browser window with the article is minimized. A web browser window with blog posting is brought on screen. The narrator continues: We find in the connotational space glowing image edge amid desktop under glass. We cast texts and songs and lights and people.
</p>
<p>07:15 The cursor scrolls to the bottom of the blog posting and selects a link that says Add comment. A comment composing widow appears. The narrator continues: I'm rolling toward the final question of the technopoet: Oh . . . Do not ask . . . must we always manifesto? The question's rhetorical. This moment is now emerging. Should we use this YouTube clip we’ve found? The question's rhetorical. How could we not? It's a part of this story, the memoir, the performance.
</p>
<p>07:50 In the comment composing window, the cursor types text: Just checking back. I’m thinking that local writerly stuff has gone global now, or just keeps slipping between the global and the local. Like a zoom tool switching our gaze. The narrator continues: This is the twenty-third take of a live improvisation. Twenty three takes among hundreds of unsaved instances coming and going like the folding edge of time. This is me typing into the take. This is you watching. This is me talking over the take. Us listening. Clicking. Moving sound. Beating. Playing with the band. Imagining. Us reworking the twenty-third take of a ten-minute moment.
</p>
<p>08:25 The live musical performance increases in intensity. The video image zooms in on the comment composing screen. The cursor continues to type: It’s still about the prosumer push, the euphoric rush picking its way through membrane. Dance of light, pixelated insight. The narrator continues: I used to think the prosumer approach was important for teaching. Of course it is, but what I’ve learned is that the prosumer is not about school. It’s about everybody making everything. That means me and you. You don't create the prosumer, you prosume. You don't study digital composing, you perform it. Must we always manifesto? Yes. The question is who will speak and what will we say as we cast our creations into the mix. The question is, what will we say.
</p>
<p>09:15 The live performance of music comes to a crescendo. In the comment composing window the cursor continues to type: Heard through air vibration tools. The tympanic mechanic with hammer and drum . . . drum drum drum. heart. ear. lung. This is me and my machine. This is the adumbrating edge where writing becomes writing. The narrator continues: We will say that words crash and sweep and wave, light speaks, and sounds have shape. Do we write these waves and shapes with our machines? Yes. Do we blow them into being like glass? Yes. Look closely—the surface, still liquid and light, refracts.
</p>
<p>09:40 In the comment composing window, the cursor continues to type: The Mobius moment where cast is cast. Where the bus stops beyond language. The narrator continues: And when we bring the shimmering thing here before us, we will say to beauty, this is truth. And we will say, don't watch your mouth. Watch the bubble. The band finishes the live performance of the song. The video ends.

<h3>Use of Materials</h3>

<p>The materials used in the video include four articles, a YouTube-hosted video
clip, sample materials from a student's course portfolio. There are also items
created by the author, including blog postings and images. The video clip hosted
on YouTube captures a live performance of the song,  Six Days At The Bottom Of
The Ocean by the band Explosions In The Sky. The song was recorded at The Parish
in Austin, Tx on October 31st and posted to YouTube on Mar 4, 2006 2003. The
clip of the live performance is incorporated into the screen performance for
Watch the Bubble. The song begins with sparse and slow-building picking of
electric guitars. I listened to the song over and over while experimenting with
numerous arrangements and possibilities for constructing a multimedia memoir.
The timing of the movements of materials on the screen--web browser windows,
file system windows, searching, typing--is co-emergent with the playing of the
video while composing. The way the song builds, shifts, and embodies performing
bubbles up in the creation of the piece, creating a transformative experience in
the process.</p>

<p>There is no understating the role of experimentation and serendipity here.
Pandora was playing on my ipad, and I liked what was coming out of the speaker,
so I checked the name of the band. Then I turned on my screen recorder, went to
YouTube, and typed in “Explosions in the Sky.” I clicked on a random video and
then began playing with the computer screen. There was an image file lying on
the desktop with some gears and other logo elements for a journal project. I
messed with the image while the video played. I started playing with screens to
bring in elements from my history with computers and writing.  The serendipity
of the of mixing materials is linked with their transformational,
improvisational use. The use is also scholarly, not for profit, and
acknowledged.  </P>

<p>“Watch the Bubble” does incorporate not a portion, but the entire
performance of the song. It becomes part of the memoir. Searching the publicly
available recordings of concerts at archive.org reveals that the band,
Explosions in the Sky, grants permission for fans to record and post their
concerts. In fact, archive.org contains a version of the same song from a
concert that took place two days before the version in the screencast was
recorded.  We might characterize the ethos of the band when it comes to sharing
live recordings as open, as inviting recording and distribution. Of course that
ethos is hinged to a corresponding ethos that would in turn be expected among
users of the material. The expectation is that users are fans engaged in
spreading the music. Or, in this case, creating something for scholarship and
art. </p>

<p>
The articles included in the piece link to
moments in the histories of both the author and the field of computers and
writing. The first article to appear on screen [02:08] brings early hypertext
concerns forward into web composing dating to 1994. It looks at multimedia
composing using the HyperCard authoring system, and shares the reflection in a
web publication. The second article looks at early web annotation efforts. The
mixing of images and words and the movements of authors onto the web recast
writing around material composing with many layers and instantiations. </p>

<p>The third article gathers these movements as the prosumer approach. In early
2003, cheaper smaller cameras and video composing tools like iMovie converged to
lower thresholds for video composing. And the fourth article looks back at early
collaborations around computers and composing to offer a yes-and model for
scholarly critique. All of these are repurposed here to lay out a history of engagements with screen composing.</p>

<p>The materials in the student portfolio show reflections on composing collages
and other multimedia projects.  Student materials in this project are used with
permission. Reflections reveal how screen composing restarts processes for
writing, how it motivates, and opens space for creativity. </p>

<h2>About the Video</h2>

<aside class="pullquote-left"> In an experimental humanities, students (and
teachers) learn to write original poetics. The value of these poetics may then
be tested by using them to see what sorts of work they help the students (or any
investigator) to generate . . . students become producers as well as consumers
of theory -- Heuretics Xiii </aside>

<p>A version of this piece was published in Kairos in 2012. An earlier version
was performed at the 2011 Computers and Writing Conference. The video was made
by screen recording a live performance. An audio track and some callouts using
bubbles were added to the screen capture. The version here has been revised
using the original screen capture, an edited script and repositioning of the
bubble callouts.</p>

<p>The educational encounters discussed in the video articulate a teaching
philosophy that is based on mentored engagement with the material world. Human
agency, Matthew Crawford suggests, "arises only within concrete limits that are
not our making" (64). An engine bolt can only take so much torque, and the
limits are best learned through guided experience. These constraints create the
conditions for learning to happen. The situation and mechanics can vary. The
materials of language work well for mentoring. The shop class and computer lab
make great spaces for learning "why certain aspects of mechanical work can't be
reduced to rule following" (24). Learning requires wrestling with material situations that evoke insights and emotions. Crawford notes that we situate ourselves when we learn this way.</p>

<aside class="pullquote-right">Knowing what <em>kind</em> of problem you have on
hand means knowing what features of the situation can be ignored. Even the
boundaries of what counts as "the situation" can be ambiguous; making
discrminiations of pertinence cannot be acheived by the application of rules,
and requires a kind of judgment that comes with experience -- Shop Class as Soulcraft 36 </aside>

<p>Screen composing brings these material engagements to the fore, makes them
part of the performed message. Crawford worries that "the computer 'interface'
adds another layer of abstraction, as it screens the user also from the
human-generated logic of the program running the software" (60). We know this
screening flows with protocols, control, power, politics. We need not move away
from from material engagements, though, as we compose with and through our
screens. And if we push the communicative affordances of the interface, we can
reveal its materiality. The interface is desinged "to introduce as little
psychic friction as possible between the user's intention and its realization"
(Crawford 61). At 02:50 in the video, the cursor moves through a serious of
folders, making poetry.</p>

<p>Gregory Ulmer builds upon Julia Kristeva's understanding of the concept of
chora as he outlines an approach to composing that he calls chorography, "a
process or movement of invention conducted as a transgression of rules (the
burlesque principkle) that undermines the plausibility and verisimilitude of
classic mimesis, argumentation, judgment, realism." (176). This transgression
calls into question classic understandings of writing. Instead, "choral writing
is a kind of dreamwork . . . drawing on . . . 'the <em>passage from one sign
system to another</em>'" (76). The psychic resistance that Crawford seeks is
easily had through mixing of materials that transgress their messaging rules.
The practice of mixing these materials using the interface as performing and
composing tool further pushes the materiality of computing into view. Crawford
might be pleased at the intervention as "the expanding empire of electronics
<em> covers over</em> the mechanical" (61). And Ulmer might be equally pleased
to see that "the choral order may be discerned in this 'passage' as a 'mechanism
of innovation' (as generative), distinct from something that is directly
intelligible or sensible" (176)</p>
