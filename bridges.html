<p>This video was originally performed at the Conference on College Composition and Communication in 2017. It combines cell phone video with videos taken from the internet and videos of student data projects. These materials are mixed as shifting layers with varying opacities in the video. It also includes music and sound effects. The transcript below captures the narration and major textual and media elements.
</p>
<p>00:00 Opening title reads: Tweet Analysis, Ambiguity, and Storytelling. A cursor appears on screen and adds text to the title that reads: A Dialog. Below the title appears the text: Daniel Anderson iamdan@unc.edu. The cursor adds @iamdan. The cursor highlights and then deletes all of the text on the title screen, and then begins typing. A computer-generated voice reads aloud the text being typed: See there is this thing called writing. And it’s great.
</p>
<p>00:30 The narrator’s voice responds: I love writing. But I’m supposed to be here to talk about data. Writing. . . . ah, I mean data is so cool. Look at how it helps us make sense of something like an election. On screen web articles discussing the 2016 election and data appear. Okay. Maybe I should rethink that. The 2016 presidential election was about the death of data, and the rise of stories.
 </p>
<p>00:52 The computer-generated voice speaks: It's not that politics don't matter, but writing, now that's a human activity.
</p>
<p>01:06 The narrator’s voice responds: I don’t know. Death is so serious. At most, maybe data just had a bad day. And if the point is to tell stories and write our lives, data is doing that even as we speak. And it’s kind of already political. And it’s kind of taken on a life of its own. Here it is built into an assignment. And here is someone using it for scholarship in the humanities, telling stories with it.
 </p>
<p>01:37. On screen an image of a web site with a class assignment appears. The narrator’s voice continues: And it’s really kind of interesting to play around with. We used this spreadsheet. It was surprisingly east to gather an archive of tweets. And then we could think about the terms that we might use to make sense of the tweets. We learned to think about data and tell some stories. Almost feels like a campfire.
</p>
<p>01:54 On screen a spreadsheet displays columns of tweets and related data. The narrator continues: And look what the machine put together for us. It’s so cool, all referenced with metadata and sortable. And watch this, we can run the tweets through a sentiment analysis analyzer. So cool. On screen a web site appears showing sentiment analysis figures for the Twitter hashtag, #posttruth. The figure shows a pie chart and bar graph with positive sentiment in green (23 responses, 85% and negative sentiment in red (4 responses, 15%).
</p>
<p>02:09 On screen a white layer appears and a cursor starts typing. The computer-generated voice speaks the text being typed: I don't think we are talking about the same thing. Sometimes you still need to draw a line
 </p>
<p>02:26 The narrator’s voice responds: I'm with you, probability 100, that computational analysis of postruth is bogus.
</p>
<p>02:32 On screen, tweets on the sentiment analysis web site are scrolled through. The narrator continues: Look at those tweets. Debates on the topic. Distopia. A wake up call. Posttruth is no positive development.
 </p>
<p>02:40 The sound of a train horn is heard at high volume. The computer-generated voice speaks: What is that?
</p>
<p>02:45 The narrator responds:  That's a train horn. They were amazing network makers in the analog days. Their horns sound lonesome.
 </p>
<p>02:50 The computer-generated voice speaks: I know that. I have access to all the databases.
 </p>
<p>02:55 The narrator speaks: It's cool that the trains run in Portland right through town, down by the river.
 </p>
<p>03:00 The computer-generated voice speaks: Yeah. Their horns sound lonesome.
 </p>
<p>03:05 The narrator speaks: Anyway, back to the tweets. We got about 1,000 of them cleaned up. And then we started assigning meaning to them, metadata. We all worked on the same spreadsheet, filling in data. And then our spreadsheet gave us these tools to computationally assist our coding.
</p>
<p>03:25 On screen a piechart in a spreadsheet shows the results of human-generated coding for positive and negative sentiment with positive sentiment in yellow (5.3%), neutral sentiment in red (32.7%) and negative sentiment in blue (62%) The narrator’s voice continues: The tweets weren't positive, obviously. We only found a positive sentiment 5.3% of the time.
 </p>
<p>03:33 The computer-generated voice speaks: I still don’t think we are on the same page. I’m talking shady characters and fuzzy operations, deep intrigue, the stuff of storytelling.
</p>
<p>03:42 The narrator speaks: Oh, this is fuzzy, and shady. Our 5.3 percent is just one study, but it feels right. Come on, just between me and you. It’s a lot of counting, interpreting, and representing. Maybe we can focus on the stories coming out of that process. Let’s look at those.
</p>
<p>04:00. On screen another spreadsheet appears. It contains data for the hashtags #notmypresident and #blacklivesmatter. A student voice speaks: I have chosen to mark as well as I can the emotions of each one within certain broad categories, the temporal focus, when is the tweet referring to. And does the tweet include a call to action no matter how big or how small.
</p>
<p>04:20 The narrator speaks: So, I asked everyone to share their discoveries from working with the data. Really, it’s pretty much like writing. It’s framing things, asking questions, representing ideas. And trying to make change in the world. In fact, the best part of the experience is the way it helps us question our basic assumptions.
 </p>
<p>04:39 On screen a student video appears. A student voice narrates the video on screen: Humans need to categorize everything. That’s the only way we can navigate in this world. But putting everything in boxes is problematic. What happens when the object does not fit. In the action of defining lines for when a term is in a category and when it’s outside lies a lot of judgment. Every word makes up for its own category: woman, sci-fi, horror, beautiful, nationality, clever, left-wing, truth, depression, art, etc. In the following I wish to investigate the three categories: human, computer, and, um, the category, category.
</p>
<p>05:23 On screen aerial footage shows two bridges over a river. The scene moves down the river as the camera flies over the bridges. The narrator speaks: I remember my dad told me a story about human development. He said, much boils down to accidents of eyes and ears. Somehow our eyes and ears evolved to either side of our heads, giving us binary brains, with switching and signals. He liked the long view. Just this week he told me things sometimes get worse before they get better. He said, what we’ve done follows from that change, from that binary brain. Our sight. Our smell. The way we walk. Our bridges. The streams of vapor we leave tracing the sky.
</p>
<p>06:05 On screen the camera continues to move over bridges and the river. The narrator continues speaking: I once wrote some poems about the organic mechanic. I layered one beneath an article about Mac and PC characters. The poems were about metaphors and the aesthetics and power of the materials and design in machines. The space shuttle. The telephone. I can tell, you bridges sing, my friend. Make no mistake about it, bridges sing.
 </p>
<p>06:36 The computer-generated voice speaks: Look, you can mix together all the people and machines you want; I still want to hear the sound of a human voice.
 </p>
<p>06:46 The narrator speaks: I hear you.
 </p>
<p>06:48 The computer-generated voice and the narrator speak in unison: Amen to that, my friend, amen. On screen, the camera flies over a bridge on which two light-rail trains are crossing. The video ends.
